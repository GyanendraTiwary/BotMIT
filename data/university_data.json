The university has an obligation to safeguard public funds and ensure that it delivers the assured value for mo ney to its students and other beneficiaries. The Tuition Fee Policy forms part of the university\u2019s Terms and Conditions and should be read in conjunction with them, for together they provide the comprehensive framework for the setting, payment, collection, and reconciliation of tuition fees. Course fees include all compulsory elements needed for students to meet the minimum learning outcomes of the course. In some courses, optional additional costs may be incurred. The purpose of this policy is to set out the tuition fee liability that applies to students upon enrolment on a course/programme of study. Scope This policy relates to: \u27a2 Student tuition fee liability This policy does not relate to: \u27a2 Non-refundable tuition fee deposits \u27a2 Accommodation fees 37 | P a g e Policy \u27a2 All students bear a personal liability for the tuition fee associated with any course/programme of study for which they enrol. \u27a2 All students must enrol for each successive year or another relevant part of their course/courses at MIT World Peace University no later than 30 days after the stating date of the respective course/courses). o Upon non -completion of enrolment by/before the prescribed deadline dates, students will be withdrawn from their ongoing course. Once withdrawn, the students\u2019 ID card will be deactivated following which they will not be able to attend lectures, use the libr ary, submit, or sit for assessments or take part in any other academic activity. \u27a2 The University has a ' fixed fee ' policy for tuition fee meaning that the fee charged at the beginning of the programme remains the same throughout that particular programme. \u27a2 The ' fixed fee ' policy will apply even if a student interrupts or repeats another year of study. \u27a2 It is the students\u2019 responsibility to ensure that they will be able to pay for their entire course duration prior to enrolment. \u27a2 Enrolment will not be permitted unless any/all outstanding debt(s) from the previous year has been paid in full or an instalment plan has been agreed upon by the university\u2019s Fee Team. \u27a2 IMPORTANT: Students are legally responsible for payment of their complete tuition fee themselves, whether they have an SLC loan or a sponsor. If the sponsor does not pay the university, or if the students find out that they are not eligible for a SLC loan, or they lose 38 | P a g e their eligibility for an SLC loan at any time after the commencement of the course, the students will be liable to pay their own fees for any/all periods of study that is not paid for by a sponsor or the SLC. This applies to all forms of undergraduate and postgraduate fee. \u27a2 Students who are considering discontinuing their programme of study are encouraged to first consult with the University for Advice and Guidance before making the final decision to leave. Further information on the range of support available can be found on the university website. \u27a2 In all cases, wherein a student withdraws from or discontinues their studies, or is granted a period of leave of absence from their studies, the date of withdrawal/discontinuation/leave of absence is accounted for by the university towards calculating the cumulative tuition fee liability. \u27a2 For students who are sponsored, in the event of the sponsor not making payment in respect of the tuition fees, the student will be personally liable for the payment. \u27a2 Students funded by the Student Loans Company (SLC) will be liable for payment of either 50% or 100% of the tuition fee loan, in line with SLC policy in case of discontinuation mid - programme. For undergraduate students starting in August, the liability will stand at 50% in case the withdrawal takes place before course commencement & remaining 50% will be liable after completion of 90 days from the course commencement date. \u27a2 The university reserves the right to take appropriate action against students who fail to pay their fees, or make satisfactory arrangements to pay on, or by the end of a set period after the starting date of their course. When to pay fees: Students either can make the full payment or can opt for the payment in instalments as per the fee payment schedule declared and published by the university. First Installment Fee will have to be paid in full for the seat to be confirmed in candidate \u2019s name (no parti al payments are permitted) .

The CGPA is also calculated in the same manner taking into account all the courses undergone by a student overall in the semester/year of a program, i.e. \u2211 (Ci x Si ) CGPA = \u2211 (Ci ) Marks Range Grade Grade Description Grade Point 90-100 O Outstanding 10 80-89 A Excellent 9 70-79 B Good 8 60-69 C Fair 7 50-59 D Average 6 Less than 50 F Fail 0 AB AB Absent 0 Page 15 of 36 where Si is the SGPA of the ith semester/year and Ci is the total number of credits in that semester /year. Marks Range Grade Grade Description Grade Point Credit Point (Credit X Grade) Course 1 3 A 8 3 X 8 = 24 Course 2 4 B+ 7 4 X 7 = 28 Course 3 3 B+ 6 3 X 6 = 18 Course 4 3 O 10 3 x 10 = 30 Course 5 3 C 5 3 X 5 = 15 Course 6 2 F 0 0 Total 18 A 8 115 The SGPA and CGPA shall be rounded off to two decimal points and reported in the transcripts.

Students will be free to choose their guide from among the faculty members for such projects. If required, the Dean of R&D will designate a faculty mentor for such projects, in consultation with the appropriate academic leader. The project approved jointly by the industry and MIT -WPU must solve a problem faced by the industry/society, resulting in the generation of intellectua l property and possibly a startup. Conditions The selection committee's decision will be considered as the \ufb01nal recommendation for granting funds. The funds must be utilized within the designated timeframe. A student or group of students must enlist the assistance of a faculty member as a mentor for the project, and the faculty mentor will be responsible for completing the project within the stipulated timeframe . 15 MIT-WPU C Innovation/Research grant outcome The research/innovation project funds must be used to initiate projects that have both technical and social signi\ufb01cance . The projects should be developed to a level where they have the potential to attract venture capital funding and enable the establishment of a startup. The developed research/innovation product or prototype should be capable of being converted into intellectual property in the form of a patent, copyright, or trademark. The developed research/innovation product or technology should have the potential to attract additional funding from external agencies like SERB, DST, DBT, ICMR, etc., to facilitate f urther development towards commercial success. The research/innovation funds must be disbursed to projects whose \ufb01ndings have the potential to be published in peer -reviewed journals. Utilization of Research/Innovation Grant The expenditure from the project fund must be strictly related to research or innovation work, such as purchasing study material or books on the research subject, materials for manufacturing speci\ufb01c components, conducting research -speci\ufb01c surveys for gathering data, purchasing spe ci\ufb01c equipment or software, etc. The project fund can also be used to pay stipends to Research Associates/UG or PG interns for activities like collecting research -related data, collating, and analyzing information, recording inferences/results, etc., which would be utilised in the project. Every expenditure must be approved by the approving authority (Dean R&D), and the actual expenditure must be made through the procurement department following standard 'Purchase & Procureme nt SoP'. After the completion of the project, an audited project report in the format prescribed by the R&D Cell must be submitted to the R&D Cell, and the research/innovation must be presented, published, or demonstrated to the university authorities whe n required.

Alongside its undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, MIT -WPU also encourages its faculty members and academic staff to undertake consultancy projects with industry and other institutions. This not only expands and strengthens the research pro\ufb01le of MIT-WPU but also creates new knowledge and broadens the experience of faculty and staff members. This document provid es a formal framework to guide the implementation of this process. AIM OF THE DOCUMENT MIT-WPU aims to be a university that fosters innovation and is committed to adopting best practices in its engagement with external organizations. The university rec ognizes that consultancy work and external activity undertaken by its staff are crucial and valuable aspects of its operations. MIT-WPU believes that such activities are essential for knowledge exchange and can result in mutually bene\ufb01cial outcomes for both, the university and external organizations. To support its staff in the delivery of approved consultancy work, MIT -WPU has established a policy that outlines the procedures and guidelines to be followed. This policy is a part of the university's human resources management procedures and forms a part of the contract of employment for the academic staff. PURPOSE The objective of this policy is to establish the rules and regulations that govern consultancy and other external service s provided by the staff of MIT -WPU. MIT-WPU acknowledges the signi\ufb01cance of its staff engaging in consultancy for external organizations, particularly for the industry. MIT -WPU recognizes this as a vital medium through which knowledge and expertise can be shared with and from businesses and other external agencies, thereby promoting the development of mutually bene\ufb01cial relationships with these organizations. Thus, MIT -WPU promotes and supports its staff members to under take consultancy and similar work, as long as it does not contradict the interests of MIT -WPU. It is expected by MIT -WPU that external consultancy engagement will be undertaken with the highest levels of professionalism and integrity by staff members. MIT-WPU expects that the consultancy work will contribute to the development of mutually bene\ufb01cial relationships with external organizations, including industry bodies, and that it will further enhance the knowledge and expertise of staff members, thus supporting the overall development of MIT-WPU. The policy aims to provide guidance and support to staf f members in undertaking consultancy work in a way that is consistent with the interests of MIT-WPU and ensures transparency, ethical practice, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations. Benefits of engagement: External consultancy provides an opportunity for the staff members to increase their professional and/or academic competence and experience, and a chance for continuing professional education by working with industry. Engaging in external consultancy can help to create and su stain relationships between MIT -WPU and external organizations, leading to bene\ufb01ts such as increased research opportunities, student admission and placement, and ultimately contributing to knowledge exchange for the bene\ufb01t of the country. External consultancy can also generate additional income for the staff members and increased funding for MIT-WPU. MIT-WPU CONSULTANCY POLICY RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 24 www.mitwpu.edu.in APPLICABILITY MIT-WPU aims to promote and support consultancy work among its staff members in accordance with the University's employment policies and regulations.

GENERAL All payments made for consultancy services must be processed through MIT -WPU's designated bank a ccount. This means that payments should be made in the name of MIT -WPU and not directly to individual faculty members. MIT-WPU will ensure compliance with statutory laws and distribute the appropriate share to the faculty/staff involved in the consultancy project. The client shall not be provided with a detailed breakdown of the consultancy charges, and only a lump sum \ufb01gure of the total consultancy charges may be quoted. Nevertheless, the working sheet must be kept as part of the internal records and may be subject to an internal audit as deemed necessary. The consultancy agreement must comply with the laws of India as per t he Standardized Terms and Conditions. However, in exceptional circumstances and with proper approvals, compliance with both local and international laws may be considered. The Principal Investigator (PI) is solely responsible for completing the project and delivering the agreed -upon deliverables. MIT-WPU only provides necessary support to the PI. After the completion of the project, the Principal Investigator (PI) shall provide a Final Project Completion Report (PCR) to the funding agency. Additionally, two copies of the report shall be submitted to the R&D Cell for record keeping. To ensure the project account can be closed by the Finance Department of MIT-WPU, it is important to obtain a Completion Certi\ufb01cate (CC) from the funding agency to con\ufb01rm the successful completion of the project. Testing and evaluation services can be provided to ful\ufb01ll the requirements of governmental and associated organizations, speci\ufb01c clients, and external educational institutions. MIT-WPU may provide Standardization and Calibration services in areas where the necessary facilities are available or can be expanded. It is recommended that these services be supported by regular calibration and standardization of the laboratory equipment used for these purposes. For signi\ufb01cant projects where the consultancy value exceeds Rs. 5 Lakhs (Rupees Five Lakhs only), payments may be accepted against agreed -upon milestones with appropriate prior approvals. However, for smaller projects or daily consultancy work, payments must be obtained in advance from the client(s). In exceptional situations where the assigned PI is unable to complete the consultancy work undertaken by MIT-WPU, MIT-WPU retains the authority to reassign the consultancy to another investigator. If completing the consultancy is deemed impossible or unfeasible by MIT-WPU, the Approver will address the matter with the client to close the project.

The project account will be handled by the faculty or principal investigator (PI), who will spend the funds as required. The institute's share should also be transferred. The requirement for a consultancy project/task/work can originate from the industry or other organizations concerned, or the faculty can approach the industry or other organizations. The faculty is expected to estimate the time and cost required to accompl ish the task. A proposal is then prepared by the principal investigator (PI). The budget for the proposal should be in one part and re\ufb02ect the project consultancy fee for the principal investigator (PI), co -PI, and other investigators, 50% overheads to MIT -WPU, and service tax on the total amount if applicable. Service tax is subject to periodic revision by the Government of India. Service tax is not applicable on projects if the funds are received in foreign currency. Expenses for equipment, supporting manpower, travel, and contingency must also be included in the budget, if necessary.

This will provide opportunities for wealth generation, alleviation of human suffering, and improvement of human life. The objective is to promote awareness and culture of IPR among the faculty, staff, and students of the Institute by implementing prudent IP management practices. Establish a centralized and comprehensive reference system to address all IPR related issues in a streamlined and ef\ufb01cient manner, making it easier for faculty, staff, and students to access infor mation and receive guidance. The IPR policy of the Institute aims to proactively create an environment that fosters the generation of new knowledge through research and innovations, while also aligning with the educational mission of the Institute. SCOPE This policy applies to all forms of intellectual property resulting from the intellectual and scienti\ufb01c pursuits of the following individuals: faculty members, staff, students, research scholars (both internal and external), individuals employed in sponsored research and consultancy projects, visiting scientists/professors/professionals who contribute to the teaching and research wor k conducted at the Institute, whether full -time or part -time, regardless of whether these rights are eligible for registration. The intellectual property generated from academic research encompasses patents, designs, copyright, know -how, and con\ufb01dential in formation. POLICY STATEMENT The Institute is dedicated to balancing the promotion, protection, management, and commercialization of intellectual property while also maintaining its core values of teaching, research, and community service. It acknowledg es the importance of commercializing and exploiting intellectual property for generating additional revenue for the Institute and offering bene\ufb01ts to its staff and students. However, the Institute also acknowledges the signi\ufb01cance of traditional academic v alues and expectations. DEFINITIONS Intellectual Property (IP) refers to intangible knowledge products and encompasses all types of results, conclusions, deductions, inventions, ideas, improvements, discoveries, enhancements, solutions, processes, modi\ufb01cations, know -how, data, and informatio n that are conceived, generated, made, or reduced to practice by the faculty, staff, students, research scholars, and other employees of the Institute. This includes designs, software programmes, genetically engineered microorganisms, business models, and copyrightable works that result from their intellectual output. IP is the result of research supported or sponsored by the Institute, industrial consulting, or other collaborative research and development efforts. Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) refers to the legal rights that are granted to individuals or entities for their creative and innovative works. These rights are derived from various forms of intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. IPR grants exclusive rights to the creators or owners of intellectual property, allowing them to contr ol the use, distribution, and commercialization of their creations. This ensures that they are able to bene\ufb01t \ufb01nancially from their work and encourages further innovation and creativity. Some examples of IPR include the following: Patents: These are legal protections granted to inventors for their new and useful inventions or discoveries. They give the inventor the exclusive right to manufacture, use, and sell the invention for a certain period. 45 C MIT-WPU RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 46 www.mitwpu.edu.in Trademarks: Copyrights: Trade Secrets: These are symbols, logos, or phrases used to identify and distinguish a particular product or service from others.

Trademarks protect the brand iden tity of a company or individual and prevent others from using similar marks that could confuse consumers. These are legal protections granted to authors, artists, and creators for their original works of expression, such as books, music, \ufb01lms, and software. Copyrights give the creator the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, and display their work. These are con\ufb01dential business information or practices that give a company a competitive advantage. Trade secret protection prevents others from using or disclosing secret information without permission. Overall, IPR plays a crucial role in protecting and incentivizing innovation and creativity by providing legal protections an d \ufb01nancial rewards for the creators and owners of intellectual property. Background information the term \"background information\" in a Collaborative Research and Development programme refers to the technical knowledge and expertise that is owned or controlled by the programme partners before the commencement of the programme. This information is typically in the same \ufb01eld as the programme's subject matter or in related \ufb01elds that are necessary for the successful execution of the programme. The term \"Institute Personnel\" as used in this policy document encompasses a wide range of individuals including but not limited to full-time and part -time faculty members, staff, students, research scholars (both internal and external), visiting scientists, professors, and other professionals who are employed or engaged by the institute. OWNERSHIP OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Whenever the Institute \ufb01les an application for ownership of intellectual property rights, it is require d to acknowledge and mention all individuals who have made signi\ufb01cant intellectual contributions to the creation or invention in question. These individuals must be identi\ufb01ed as inventors or creators in the application. Copyrights The ownership of copyright on all teaching and instructional materials created by employees of the Institute as part of any academic programmes or activities shall belong to the Institute. However, the author(s) of such materials shall retain the right to use the materials in their professional work. This clause does not apply to books, articles, monographs, speeches, and other works produced by the Institute staff members during research and teaching, using Institute resources. The Institute acknowledges and recognizes that the faculty members own the copyright to such traditional works of authorship. In situations where Institute employees have created copyrightable works, including software, using. signi\ufb01cant Institute resources, the Institute may require the employees to assign some or all of the copyright to such works. The extent to which the Institute's resources have been used to produce the copyrightable work will determine the extent of the assignment of the copyright. The Institute shall have ownership of the copyright of works created by non-Institute personnel who are engaged or associated with any Institute activity, regardless of whether Institute personnel have made intellectual contributions to such works or not. In cases where copyrightable works are created during sponsored or collaborative activities, the ownership of copyright shall be determined either in accordance with the terms and conditions related to intellectual property speci\ufb01ed in the contract governing such activity (if any), or through mutual consultations and agreement between the Institute and the sponsoring/collaborating agency. 47 www.mitwpu.edu.in In the case of a thesis, dissertation, or project report written by a student, the ownership of copyright shall be jointly held by the student and their guide. However, the Institute may demand the full assignment of the copyright in such cases. In cases where the Institute does not demand the assignment of copyright or where the copyright has not been assigned to the Institute, the Institute shall be entitled to a non -exclusive, non -transferable lic ense to use the work within the Institute for non-commercial educational and research purposes. Additionally, the Institute may possess a limited number of copies of the work for such purposes. Unless otherwise speci\ufb01ed in the original contract for the work, any copyrightable work that is generated as a work -for-hire shall normally belong to the Institute. If the Institute anticipates a potential \ufb01nancial gain from any copyrights, it may take steps to \ufb01le and protect such copyrights and share the result ing \ufb01nancial bene\ufb01ts with the creator(s) according to the terms and conditions established by the Institute. Institute - Supported Research All intellectual property rights arising from investigations conducted at the Institute using the Institute's resources shall belong to and be the exclusive property of the Institute, except in cases where such investigations are conduct - ed jointly with o ther institutions and agencies or are sponsored by an outside agency. Sponsored Research The intellectual property rights (IPR) of inventions resulting from research projects that are carried out on behalf of and fully funded by a sponsoring agency shall be registered jointly in the name of the Institute and the sponsoring agency if the cost of securing and maintaining the IPR registration is shared equally between the Institute and the sponsoring agency. However, if the sponsoring agency",

Institute - Supported Research All intellectual property rights arising from investigations conducted at the Institute using the Institute's resources shall belong to and be the exclusive property of the Institute, except in cases where such investigations are conduct - ed jointly with o ther institutions and agencies or are sponsored by an outside agency. Sponsored Research The intellectual property rights (IPR) of inventions resulting from research projects that are carried out on behalf of and fully funded by a sponsoring agency shall be registered jointly in the name of the Institute and the sponsoring agency if the cost of securing and maintaining the IPR registration is shared equally between the Institute and the sponsoring agency. However, if the sponsoring agency is not willing to share the costs of registration and maintenance, the IPR shall belong exclusively to the Institute. If the sponsoring agency is not willing to share the cost of securing and maintaining the IPR registration for jointly \ufb01led applications, the Institute may, at its discretion, \ufb01le the application with sole ownership and bear the entire cost of securing and protecting the IPR. In cases where the research project is only partially funded by the sponsoring agency or if there are multiple sponsors for the same project, the sharing of IPR shall be determined through mutual consultations and appropriate agreements between the Institute and the sponsoring agency(ies). If the sponsoring agency is an industry, they may choose one of the following options for sharing the IPR with the Institute: The Institute may enter into an agreement with the sponsoring industry where the ownership of IPR will rest with the industry. However, the industry will have to pay the Institute an initial lump sum and reasonable annual royalties for a speci\ufb01c period as recognition of the Institute's contribution to the project. The terms of ownership of the IPR will be governed by a speci\ufb01c prior agreement between the Institute and the sponsoring industry. The ownership of IPR rested in the sponsoring industry may be exclusive or non -exclusive. In case of exclusive ownership, if the industrial sponsor fails to exploit within a mutually agreed time limit, the Institute may permit third -party exploitation of the IPR. The Institute shall retain ownership of the IPR, but the industrial sponsor shall have the right to exploit the IPR either exclusively or non-exclusively. This right will be granted in exchang e for an initial lump sum payment, subsequent annual royalties for a speci\ufb01ed period, or other bene\ufb01ts to the Institute as mutually agreed upon. In cases of exclusive exploitation rights, if the industrial sponsor fails to exploit the IPR within an agreed -upon time limit, third -party exploitation may be permitted. The Institute shall retain user rights for the purposes of further research and development. The terms of ownership and exploitation rights will be governed by a speci\ufb01c prior agreement between the Institute and the sponsoring industry. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 Joint Research In the case of intellectual property resulting from joint research conducted by Institute personnel with external organizations/agencies/individuals, the ownership of the IP will be jointly shared by the Institute and the collaborators. The cost of \ufb01ling a nd maintaining the IPR as well as the revenue generated from its commercial exploitation will be shared by both parties according to an agreed -upon formula. If the collaborators do not agree to share the cost, the Institute may decide at its discretion to \ufb01le and maintain the IPR at its own expense. In such cases, the sharing of revenue resulting from the commercial exploitation of the IPR will be determined solely by the Institute. Technology Transfer The Institute will make all efforts to commercially exploit the IPR obtained, either solely or jointly with other agencies, to the fullest extent reasonably possible and without unnecessary delay. The marketing of the IPR will be conducted through technology transfer agreements, licensing (both exclusive and non-exclusive), and revenue -sharing models. The Institute will attempt to \ufb01nd potential licensees to commercially exploit the intellectual property (IP) that it owns outright. If the IP is jointly owned, the Institute will offer the \ufb01rst opportunity to commercially exploit it to the joint owners, regardless of whether the IP is protected by patents or not. This licensing agreement would require a lump sum payment as a technology transfer fee, as well as ongoing royalty payments for an agreed -upon period from the start of commercial exploitation. If the joint owner declines this option, the Institute will move forward with commercializing the IP in a manner it sees \ufb01t. If the other collaborating organization or industry does not undertake commercial exploitation within two years from the initial development of the technology, the Institute retains the right to license the use of the intellectual property to a third party. The Institute may support entrepreneurial activities among its staff by transferring ownership of an intellectual property to the inventor(s) or creator(s) of the property, through an agreement. This will enable the staff member s to market, protect, and license the intellectual property independently, with minimal involvement from the Institute. The Institute requires the assignee to pay all expenses related to patenting and licensing, as well as any royalties, equity, or other value received by the inventor(s) or creator(s). The Institute would make efforts to commercialize intellectual property, either through its own means or by hiring a Technology Management Agency to develop the IP created by its staff. After a speci\ufb01ed period, the inventor(s) or creator(s) may request that the Institute transfer the rights",

After a speci\ufb01ed period, the inventor(s) or creator(s) may request that the Institute transfer the rights to them. Revenue Sharing The sole applicant for any intellectual property (IP) generated at MIT-WPU will be the institute itself, and no sharing of revenue will occur, even if the IP is commercialized. However, in cases where the institute chooses to transfer the IP rights to the inventor(s)/creator(s), the inventor(s)/creator(s) will be required to reimburse the institute for all costs incurred in protecting, maintaining, marketing, and otherwise associated with the IP. 48 C MIT-WPU 49 www.mitwpu.edu.in Infringements, Damages, Liability, and Indemnity Insurance As a policy, the Institute will require any licensee to provide indemni\ufb01cation against any legal proceedings, including but not limited to those arising from manufacturing defects, production problems, design guarantees, and obligations related to upgrades and debugging, in any contract between the licensee and the Institute. The Institute will include an indemnity clause in agreements with licensees when transferring technology or copyrighted material, to protect its personne l. The Institute will also retain the right to decide whether or not to engage in any litigation concerning patents and license infringements. Conflict of Interest Inventors must disclose any con\ufb02icts of interest or potential con\ufb02icts of interest. If the inventor(s) or their immediate family have a stake in a licensee or potential licensee company, they must disclose the stake they or their immediate family have in the company. In the case of a license or an assignment of rights for a patent to a company where the inventor(s) have a stake, the approval of the IPR Cell will be required. Dispute Resolution If there are any disputes between the Institute and the inventors concerning the implementation of the IP policy, the aggrieved party can appeal to the Vice Chancellor of the Institute. The Institute will make efforts to address the concerns of the aggrieved party. However, the decision of the Chancellor will be \ufb01nal and binding in this matter. APPLICATION OF POLICY This policy is considered a part of the conditions of employment for every employee of the Institute, as well as a condition of enrollment and attendance for students at the Institute. The policy applies to all existing staff and students upon enrollment. Bottom of Form The Institute retains the right to amend the IPR Policy as necessary or deemed appropriate. All potential cre ators who use Institute -sponsored resources or participate in a sponsored research project must comply with this policy and accept the principles of intellectual property ownership outlined in this policy, unless an exception is approved in writing by the Institute. RIGHT TO REGULATE POLICY The IPR Cell is responsible for interpreting the policy, resolving disputes, and applying the policy. The cell may also recommend changes to the policy p eriodically to the Registrar and Vice Chancellor, who will make decisions on any suggested changes. The IPR policy may be reviewed every three years, or earlier if there is a signi\ufb01cant change in the national policy. LEGAL JURISDICTION As a policy, all ag reements signed by the Institute and any resulting disputes will be subject to the legal jurisdiction of the Court of Adjudication in Pune only. These agreements will be governed by the appropriate laws of India.

IP PROTECTION -SOME EXPLANATORY NOTES (To be read in conjunction with MIT-WPU IPR\u2013Annexure: some useful information on patents and copyright) Intellectual property can take various forms such as patents, industrial designs, trademarks, copyrights, con\ufb01dential information, technical know -how, mask works, processes, plans, speci\ufb01cations, guidelines, graphics, training materials, softwa re programmes, records, drawings, instruction guides, student materials, new techniques, algorithms, concepts, and more. To be protected by MIT World Peace University, the intangible product of the intellect must have potential for industrial application o r for enhancing the S&T knowledge base. A patent can be awarded for any invention that is capable of being commercially applied. To meet the patentability standards, the invention must satisfy the criteria of novelty, utility, and non -obviousness. Addition ally, there must be an inventive step, which refers to an innovation that is not apparent to a person with ordinary skill in the relevant \ufb01eld. The invention may pertain to a new product, an improvement to an existing product, or a new process of manufacturing an existing or new product. Design protection can be obtained for any prototype that in\ufb02uences the consumer's choice by appealing to their aesthetic sense. In simpler terms, design protection can be secured for the appearance, visual features, and overall look of the article. However, design protection is not available for functional features. Patents are intended to safeguard applied and extension research, while copyright law is designed to protect pure or fundamental research. To meet the requirements of copyright law, a work must be original, meaning it originates from the author. Unlike patents, copyright law does not require compulsory registration.

To meet the requirements of copyright law, a work must be original, meaning it originates from the author. Unlike patents, copyright law does not require compulsory registration. Under copyright law, only the form of expression can be protected and not the idea itself. Copyright applies to various types of original works speci\ufb01ed in the copyright Act, including literary, dramatic, musical, or artistic works, cinematograph \ufb01lms, and sound recordings. Literary works may include computer programmes, tables, and compilations, including computer databases. Know -how and con\ufb01dential information can only be protected as long as the owner can keep them con\ufb01dential and take action against any unauthorized use of such information by others through a breach of con\ufb01dence or contract lawsuit. PROCEDURE FOR IP PROTECTION All patent and copyright applications (as per profo rma MIT -WPU/IPR -01 and MIT -WPU/IPR -02, respectively) must be sent to the Convener/Dean R&D through the IPR Cell via the Dean of the School or Director of the Center, regardless of whether the inventions have resulted from in - house projects or sponsored projects. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 52 MIT-WPU C RECORD KEEPING PROCEDURES All data and details produced by a creator during the creation of intellectual property should be meticulously documented in the relevant School/Centre, with speci\ufb01c emphasis on the following: Avoid using abbreviations or technical terms that are not commonly understood, unless they are explained in a table at the beginning or end of the book. This will ensure that readers who are not familiar with the terminology can understand the text without confusion or dif\ufb01culty. Important information such as data, descriptions, or experiments that pertain to signi\ufb01cant inventions or discoveries should be attributed and documented by the individual(s) responsible for the project, such as the creator, supervisor, or coordinator. I. Any changes that need to be made should be indicated by crossing out the deleted content and labeling it as \"cancelled\". The corrected data, clearly marked as such, should be entered immediately below and authenticated by the creator with their initials an d the date. II. In cases where new products are created or produced by a new method, it is advisable to preserve samples and take photographs for record keeping purposes. All photographs should be dated and signed by the creator on the back. When Should Faculty Approach IPR Cell To Discuss a Possible Patent? MIT-WPU has established an exclusive IPR Cell to manage intellectual property rights. Faculty members who have created potential intellectual property while employed by MIT-WPU can approach the IPR Cell advisor to arrange a discussion at a mutually convenient time. It is recommended that this discussion occurs well in advance of the idea maturing into a process or product. If the invention is only in the conception stage, it is possible to \ufb01le a provisional speci\ufb01cation, which must be followed up with a complete speci\ufb01cation within 12 months; otherwise, the patent application will be considered abandoned. However, if the inventor has an innovative product that can be immediately marketed, a complete speci\ufb01cation can be lod ged right away. EVALUATION OF PATENT/COPYRIGHT APPLICATIONS The IPR Cell will receive and examine each patent/copyright application submitted through an Invention Disclosure Form/Copyright Disclosure form according to the MIT-WPU/IPR -01/MIT -WPU/IPR -02 proforma. Additionally, an IPR facilitation request (MIT -WPU/IPR -03) must be included. The committee may request assistance from other professors who are experts in the relevant \ufb01eld to conduct an initial evaluation of proposals for their potential patentability. These domain experts will be required to sign a non-Disclosure agreement according to the MIT -WPU/IPR -04 proforma and a No Con\ufb02ict -of-Interest Form according to the MIT -WPU/IPR -05 profor ma before being granted access to the proposal. If necessary, the inventors may be asked to present their case before the IPR Cell. If the Cell recommends \ufb01ling for patents, the Convener of the IPR Cell will facilitate the application through one of the a pproved attorneys from the panel maintained by the IPR Cell. ASSISTANCE IN FILLING THE PROFORMA Once the IPR Cell approves protecting the Intellectual output, a patent Attorney shall be identi\ufb01ed by the Cell for drafting the IP application. The following aspects need to receive attention: Objective of the invention: What problem is the inventor trying to solve? What are the issues involved? The objective of the invention should clearly state the problem that the inventor is trying to solve. This should be a concise statement that identi\ufb01es the issues involved in the invention. For example, the objective of the invention might be to develop a more ef\ufb01cient method for processing data or to create a new device that solves a speci\ufb01c problem in a particular industry. 53 www.mitwpu.edu.in What prior art searches have been made?

Who are responsible for administration of IPRs in the country? The Controller General of Patents, Designs, and Trademarks is responsible for overseeing patents, designs, and trademarks. This department operates under the Ministry of Industry's Department of Industrial Development. Copyright, on the other hand, falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Human Resource Development. 4. What is a patent? A patent is a legal monopoly which is granted for a limited time to the owner of an invention. Patent rights A patent is a legal right granted by the state that provides a limited -time monopoly to the owner of an invention. Simply possessing a patent does not automatically give the owner the right to use or exploit the patented invention; other laws and regulations, such as those governing health and safety, food and drugs, and inheritance, may also affect these rights. Patent rights can be sold, licensed, inherited, abandoned, and may even be subject to revocation by the state in certain circumstances, both before and aft er the grant of the patent. Additionally, there are global patents available for international protection. 55 www.mitwpu.edu.in 5. What is the distinction between patented invention and know -how? According to the law, a patent speci\ufb01cation does not have to disclose all the information required for the commercial exploitation of the invention. Therefore, the information provided in a patent speci\ufb01cation may not be suf\ufb01cient for commercialization purposes. In contrast, known -how refers to all the information necessary for commercializing an invention, such as details of production methods and design drawings needed to set up a production plant. If known -how is developed around an existing patent and subsequently commercialized without the patentee's agreement, it may be considered an infringement of the patent unless the patentee has agreed to such commercialization on mutually. Agreed terms. 6. How is an invention interpreted? For an invention to be considered patentable, it must not only be novel, but also involve an inventive step. This means that the invention must not be obvious to a person skilled in the relevant \ufb01eld, taking into consideration the state of the art, but disregarding unpublished pending patent applications. However, simplicity is not necessarily a barrier to securing a patent. The means of achieving the desired outcome may be simple and common, but an inventive step may still exist if the inventor has developed a variant that produces more useful results. It does not matter whether the invention was developed by accident, as long as it involves some level of inventive step. Whether or not it has been in the meantime sold or licensed. There is no such thing as What are patentable inventions under the patent Act, 1970? Invention means any new and useful: Art, process, method, or manner of manufacture Machines, apparatus, or another article Substances produced by manufacture and included any new and useful improvements of any of them and an alleged invention. However, inventions claiming substances intended for use; or capable of being used, as food or as medicine of drug or relating to subst ances prepared or produced by chemical processes (including alloys, optical glass, semi -conductors, and inter -metallic compounds) are not patentable. 7. How is the novelty of and invention determined? The novelty of an invention is determined based on the knowledge that is available globally, including in India, at the time of \ufb01ling the patent application. This means that the invention should not have been known or disclosed to the public anywhere in the world before the \ufb01ling date of the patent application . 8. What are the types of inventions which are not patentable? An invention which is frivolous, or which claims anything obviously contrary to well established natural laws e.g., different types of perpetual motion or machines which violate the third law of thermodynamics. An invention that has a primary or intended use which is contrary to law or morality or injurious to public health is not considered patentable. For example, a process for preparing a beverage that involves the use of a carcinogenic substance, even if the beverage has a higher nourishment value, would not be considered patentable. The mere discovery of a scienti\ufb01c principle or the form ulation of an abstract theory is not patentable. For example, the discovery of the Raman Effect, which is a scienti\ufb01c principle, cannot be patented. However, an invention that makes use of scienti\ufb01c principle or theory can be patented if it meets the criteria of novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability. To be patentable, the invention must involve an inventive step. Thus, the mere discovery of any new property or",

Thus, the mere discovery of any new property or new use of a known substance or the mere use of a known process, machine or apparatus is not considered patentable, unless such a known process results in a new product or employs at least one new reactant. In other words, there must be some degree of i nnovation and improvement in the known substance or process to be eligible for a patent. A substance that is created by simply mixing existing substances together, resulting only in the combination of their properties, is not patentable. The same applies to a process for creating such a substance. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 56 MIT-WPU C The mere arrangement, rearrangement, or duplication of features of known devices, each functioning independently of one another in a known way, is not considered an invention and hence not patentable. In other words, a patent cannot be granted for a combin ation of known features that does not result in any new or improved function or technical effect. A method or process of testing applicable during the process of manufacture for rendering the machine, apparatus, or other equipment more ef\ufb01cient. A method of agriculture or horticulture. Any process for medicinal, surgical, curative, prophylactic or other treatment of human \u2018beings, or any process for a simila r treatment of animals or plants. Invention relating to atomic energy. 9. When should an application for a patent be \ufb01led? a) It is important to \ufb01le a patent application as soon as possible, rather than waiting until the invention is fully developed for commercial use. Filing an application with a provisional speci\ufb01cation can help establish priority for the applicant. Delay in \ufb01ling an application can lead to risks such as other inventors applying for a patent for the same invention before the \ufb01rst inventor, or inadvertent publica tion of the invention by the inventor or others independently. What are the essential patent documents to be generated and submitted by a potential patentee? b) There are two types of patent documents usually known as patent speci\ufb01cation namely. Provisional speci\ufb01cation Complete speci\ufb01cation PROVISIONAL SPECIFICATION To add to the previous answer, a complete speci\ufb01cation is a detailed description of the invention and how to make and use it. It should include claims that de\ufb01ne the scope of the invention for which protection is sought. The claims must be clear, concise, and supported by the description. The complete speci\ufb01cation must be \ufb01led within 12 months from the date of \ufb01ling the provisional speci\ufb01cation, and failure to do so will result in the abandonment of the application. It's also worth noting that while a provisional speci\ufb01cation may be \ufb01led without any claims, the complete speci\ufb01cation must include at least one claim de\ufb01ning the scope of the invention. The claims must be carefully drafted to ensure that they are not overly broad or vague, which could result in the patent being challenged or invalidated later. The provisional speci\ufb01cation is not a permanent and independent scienti\ufb01c cum legal document. It is a temporary document \ufb01led to establish priority of the invention and to secure a \ufb01ling date. Amendments to the provisional speci\ufb01cation can be made at any time before \ufb01ling a complete speci\ufb01cation. However, once a complete speci\ufb01cation is \ufb01led, amendments to the provisional speci\ufb01cation are not allowed. COMPLETE SPECIFICATION To obtain a patent, it is necessary to submit a Complete Speci\ufb01cation. This speci\ufb01cation should include informa - tion about the \ufb01eld to which the invention relates, the background of the prior art, any drawbacks related to the previously known details of the invention, the best way of carrying out the invention, and claims that de\ufb01ne the scope of the invention. The Complete Speci\ufb01cation should provide enough information to enable a person skilled in the art to work on the invention without requiring assistance from the inventor. 57 www.mitwpu.edu.in 10. What are the criteria for naming inventors(s) in an application for patent? The naming of inventors is normally decided based on the following criteria: All persons who have contributed towards the conception or reduction to practice of at least one claim of the invention should be named as an inventor. Intellectual contribution towards the results of the research work leading to a patent is not suf\ufb01cient for being named as an inventor. Contribution towards the conception or reduction to practice of at least one claim of the invention is necessary. A person who has not contributed to the conception or reduction to practice of at least one claim of the invention is not entitled to be included as an inventor. A person who provides only routine assistance, such as making dr awings or constructing a prototype under the direction of an inventor, is not entitled to be named as an inventor. Dif\ufb01culties may arise in determining who should be named as an inventor, and to avoid such situations,",

Dif\ufb01culties may arise in determining who should be named as an inventor, and to avoid such situations, it is important for all researchers to maintain clear and accurate records of their work in a consecutively numbered diary, with entries signed by both the researchers and their team leader. 11. Can a published or disclosed invention be patented? To clarify, if an inventor publicly discloses their invention before \ufb01ling a patent application, it could potentially prevent them from obtaining a patent. This is because one of the requirements for obtaining a patent is that the invention must be new and non -obvious at the time the patent application is \ufb01led. If the invention has already been publi cly disclosed, it may no longer meet the novelty requirement. Therefore, it is generally recommended that inventors do not disclose their inventions publicly before \ufb01ling a patent application. Instead, they should keep their invention con\ufb01dential and \ufb01le a patent application as soon as possible. If an inventor does choose to disclose their invention before \ufb01ling a patent application, they may still be able to obtain a patent if they \ufb01le the application within a certain time frame. In the United States, for example, inventors have one year from the date of the \ufb01rst public disclosure to \ufb01le a patent application. If an inventor does obtain a patent, they should include the patent number and date in any subsequent publications or disclosures related to the invention. This provides information to the public about the existence of the patent and its scope of protection. 12. What is considered the date of patent? The date on which the complete speci\ufb01cation is \ufb01led is considered the date of patent, and it is a crucial date for determining the legal protection of the invention covered by the patent. The term of the patent is calculated from this date, and it is from this date that the exclusive rights of the patent holder begin. 13. What is the term of a patent in Indian system? The term of every patent in India is 20 years, starting from the date of \ufb01ling of the patent application, regardless of whether it was \ufb01led with a provisional or complete speci\ufb01cation. However, for applications \ufb01led under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), the term of 20 years begins from the international \ufb01ling date. 14. How does one keep a patent in force for the full patent terms? To maintain a patent's validity, the patent holder is required to pay renewal fees at regular intervals. If the renewal fees are not paid, the patent will expire and will no longer be legally enforceable. Once a patent has expired, the invention becomes open to the public, and anyone can use, manufacture or sell the invention without permission from the original patent holder. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 58 MIT-WPU C 15. What is expected from a patentee? As per Indian patent law, it is expected that a patent holder should work their invention in India on a commercial scale and without any unnecessary delay. A patent is not granted simply to provide a monopoly to the patent holder for importing the patented product into India. This means that a patent holder ca nnot simply hold onto their invention and prevent others from using it. The intention behind granting a patent is to promote innovation and encourage the progress of technology, and to ensure that the invention is being utilized for the bene\ufb01t of society. 16. What is the nature of the information needed while consulting a patent attorney? When working with a patent agent or attorney to \ufb01le a patent application, it is important to provide them with a clear and comprehensive explanation of the invention. This may include information about the history of the invention, including where the idea came from and how it was developed. Any early failures or prototypes may also be relevant to understanding the inventive step involved in the invention. It is important to highlight what you believe to be the most central and inventive aspect of the invention, as well as any similar prior inventions that may exist. If you have developed an improved version of a competitor's product, it is important to disclose this information to the patent agent. Honesty and transparency in these matters will help the patent agent to draft claims and speci \ufb01cations that accurately re\ufb02ect the invention and avoid any potential for excessive claims that could be rejected. By providing your patent agent with a comprehensive understanding of your invention, including its history, inventive elements, and any prio r inventions or improvements, they will be better equipped to draft a strong patent application that maximizes the protection of your invention. In order to \ufb01le a strong patent application, it is important to provide a detailed description of how the inve ntion can be practically used, as well as any test results or trials conducted",

The Intellectual Property could be protected in the form of: Patent (to be registered) , Design Registrations (to be registered) , Trademark (registered or otherwise) , Copyright refers to the legal protection granted to the creators of original works of authorship, such as literary, artistic, and musical works, in various forms including registered or unregistered. In the context of the Institute, it may include plans, speci\ufb01cations, guidelines, graphics, training materials, software programmes, records, drawings, instruction guides, student materials, new techniques, algorithms, concepts, and other forms of creative expression. Con\ufb01dential information and technical know -how may also be protected under copy right law if they are embodied in original works of authorship. Mask works, which are designs used to create semiconductor chips, may also be protected under copyright law. Additionally, copyright protection may extend to the processes used to create works of authorship, such as the techniques used to produce a particular type of artwork or the algorithms used to generate computer programmes. Intellectual Property (IP) refers to intangible creations of the mind, such as inventions, ideas, designs, software programmes, and other forms of knowledge. It includes all results, conclusions, deductions, improvements, discoveries, solutions, processes, modi\ufb01cations, data, and information generated or produced by the faculty, staff, students, research scholars, and other employees of the Institute. IP is the result of research activities supported or sponsored by the Institute, industrial consulting, or other forms of joint research and development work. The ownership of IP resulting from such activities is determined by the Institute's IP policy. A patent application accompanied by a provisional application does not provide legal rights to the applicants. However, it is a crucial document that establishes the earliest ownership of an invention. This can be important in cases where multiple parties claim ownership of an invention. The provisional application establishes the priority date of the invention, which can be crucial in determining who has the right to \ufb01le a patent application \ufb01rst. SALIENT FEATURES OF IPR AND SERVICES PROVIDED BY IPR CELL RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 MIT-WPU C EXCEPTIONS FOR PATENT: To clarify, inventions that claim substances that are intended for use as food, medicine, or drugs, or that are capable of being used as such, are not patentable. Similarly, inventions that relate to substances that are prepared or produced by chemical processes, including alloys, optical glass, semi -conductors, and inter -metallic compounds, are also not patentable. WHETHER PATENT CAN BE REVOKED: Since a patent is granted by the state, it can also be revoked by the state under certain circumstances, even after it has been granted. It's important to note that a patent can be revoked by the state regardless of whether it has been sold or licensed in the meantime. CONTEST/CONFLICT WITH SPONSORING AGENCY: If the sponsoring agency does not cooperate in \ufb01ling a joint intellectual property rights (IPR) application, the Institute may choose to \ufb01le the application on its own with complete ownership and will bear all costs associated with securing and protecting the IPR. Copyright law protects pure or basic research, whereas patents seek to protect applied and extended research. If the intellectual property results from joint research carried out by Institute personnel and external organizations/ agencies/individuals, the ownership of the IP will be shared jointly by the Institute and the collaborators. In such cases, the Institut e will have the \ufb01rst right to commercially exploit the joint IP, regardless of whether it has been formally protected by patent(s) or not. IP COUNSELLING: The IPR cell will provide guidance and support to potential inventors of intellectual products and will assist the Institute in identifying the potential for IPR. If the cell recommends \ufb01ling for patents, the Convener/Dean R&D through the IPR cell will process the application through an approved attorney from the panel maintained by the IPR cell.

If any copyrightable work is created during sponsored or collaborative activities, ownership of the copyright will be determined by the terms and conditions outlined in the relevant contract or through mutual agreement with the sponsoring/collaborating agency. All faculty members, staff, students, research scholars (internal and external), visiting scientists, professors, and other professionals, whether full-time or part -time, can avail themselves of the services provided by the IPR cell. MIT -WPU has established sy stems and mechanisms to facilitate the commercial exploitation of the knowledge generated at the Institute under the provisions of the IPR regime in the country. SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE IPR CELL: It is crucial to respond promptly and accurately to queries from the patent agent both during the initial search and throughout the patent application process. This will facilitate the progress of the patent application and potentially save money. The IPR cell will periodically suggest patentable technologi es to potential licensing agencies, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), and other \ufb01nancial institutions, encouraging them to invest in venture capital for new technologies. 63 www.mitwpu.edu.in Is it possible to utilize the services of MIT -WPU IPR Cell to apply for a patent and get it granted? Certainly, I understand. The IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) Cell at MIT -WPU is responsible for assisting faculty members, research associates, research scholars, students, and other researchers working at MIT -WPU in obtaining patents for their inventio ns. In what proportion would the expenditure to be incurred for getting the patent granted be shared between MIT -WPU and the inventors? To clarify, if an inventor processes their patent application through MIT-WPU IPR Cell and MIT-WPU is designated as the assignee for the granted patent, then MIT-WPU is responsible for paying the fees associated with the various stages of the patent application process. In this case, the inventor is not required to pay any fees. If the expenditure to be incurred for the patenting process is fully borne by MIT-WPU, what will be royalty share for inventors after the patent is granted and we go for commercialization? As MIT-WPU is the sole applicant, there is no revenue sharing model, even for commercialized patents. Can you help us with the complete rules and regulations of the patent application and regulations followed by the MIT -WPU IPR Cell? Please go through the links \u2018frequently asked questions\u2019 and \u2018IPR Policy\u2019 under \u201cIPR Cell\u201d link at MIT-WPU Website. Is it possible to apply for a patent as an individual without help from MIT -WPU? To put it another way, if the invention is the result of work conducted by a researcher during their time at MIT-WPU and if the facilities provided by MIT -WPU were utilized in the creation of the invention, then it is expected that the inventor will \ufb01le their patent application through the MIT -WPU IPR Cell and designate MIT -WPU as the assignee. If the patent application is not processed through MIT -WPU IPR Cell, will MIT -WPU still \ufb01nancially support the patenting process? To rephrase, if the inventor chooses not to apply for a patent through the MIT-WPU IPR Cell, then MIT-WPU will not assume any responsibility for the costs associated with the patenting process. What is the documentation to be submitted to IPR Cell and what is the mode of submission, when one makes a beginning with patenting his invention? The Inventor is required to submit their proposal in the format of an Invention Disclosure Form (IDF) when making their proposal. It's important to note that the format of the IDF differs depending on whether it is for a patent or a design registration. The blank IDF for patent or design registration can be downloaded from the IPR Cell link on the MIT -WPU website. It's worth noting that there have been instances where Inventors have submitted Forms 1, 2, 3, and 5 of the Indian Patents Act 1970 as part of their proposal. However, it's important to remember that these forms are not required to be submitted to the IPR Cell. Instead, only the IDF is necessary for submitting the proposal. If the proposal is for a design registration, the Inventors must enter into an \"Agreement on Designs\" with MIT -WPU on a non -judicial stamp paper worth Rs. 20. A template for the agreement can be downloaded from the IPR Cell link on the MIT -WPU website. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ) RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 MIT-WPU C Which are the points which need particular attention, while \ufb01lling in the Invention Disclosure Form (IDF) for patents? The following points in IDF require particular attention: Point 8: General area of the patent: Please be speci\ufb01c.

The policy encompasses all forms of research that involve human participants, their tissues, or data, and should also be applied more broadly to activities such as enterprise and innovation, or service evaluation and audit, where ethical issues may arise. These policies are applicable to all research conducted by MIT-WPU's faculty and students. For studies that have obtained external ethical approval, there is no need to repeat the process. The appropriate University Ethics Committee must be informed and provided with a copy of the approval. The Ethics Committee will con\ufb01rm that no additional approval is necessary for the study. This policy is applicable to all individuals conducting research either within the University or on behalf of it. This includes staff, individuals with honorary University appointments, visiting researchers, undergraduate and postgraduate students, as well as visiting scholars and students. When a research project is being carried out by academics from multiple institutions, the lead institution (usually the institution where the Principal Investigator is employed) should seek the relevant ethical clearance for the project, and other partner institutions should be informed of any outcomes and issues. PURPOSE The aim of this policy and procedure is to establish and promote the highest ethical standards in academic research. The University is dedicated to safeguarding the rights, dignity, safety, and privacy of research subjects, as well as the well -being of animals, and ensuring environmental protection. Additionally, the University is committed to minimizing health and safety risks for researchers and upholding their academic freedom. The Institutional Ethics Committee of MIT-WPU will evaluate and approve all research proposals involving human participants, taking into account the welfare and safety of actual and potential research participants. The goals of research, no matter how important, should never be prioritized over the health and well -being of the research subjects. GUIDELINES Researchers af\ufb01liated with MIT-WPU must seek approval from the Ethics Committee. The ethical review process should ensure adherence to the following policy documents of MIT-WPU. a. Policy for Promotion of Research b. Plagiarism Policy c. Patent Policy d. Consultancy Policy ETHICS COMMITTEE 77 www.mitwpu.edu.in The University mandates an ethical review of all research projects that involve primary research with human subjects (or their data), regardless of funding source. In most cases, a review would be conducted by a Research Ethics Committee. Projects involving living persons, human tissues, or data related to recently deceased persons, as well as projects involving animals (including animals living in their natural habitats), must have genuine research, educational, or training purpose. Ethical approval is required for all research involving human participants, human material, or human data. Howe ver, research that uses information about human participants that is publicly and lawfully available, such as census data, population statistics, court reports, and personal letters or diaries in public libraries, is exempt from this requirement. The University has a Code of Ethics for Research that includes funda mental principles to protect human participants. The University requires that all research falling under this policy must adhere to the Code of Ethics and its fundamental principles. The University's policies,",

The University requires that all research falling under this policy must adhere to the Code of Ethics and its fundamental principles. The University's policies, committees, and sub -committees must consider the relevant professional ethical codes and research sponsor policies. If there is a difference in ethical standards between the University policy and the relevant professional body or research sponsor, the committees should apply the highest standard of ethical practice. Research ethics committees should be appropriate to the disciplinary mix of research they will review, comply with speci\ufb01c funding or professional body requirements, and comply with relevant legislative requirements. They should also consider the anticipated volume of work. Every research ethics committee should not only take the responsibility of reviewing and approving all research within its jurisdiction but also create and endorse research ethics toolkits. These toolkits should include standard consent forms, participant information sheets, and protocols for ensuring security, con\ufb01dentiality, anonymization, and retention o f data. It is essential for all research ethics committees to maintain detailed records of their proceedings and decisions. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 MIT-WPU C APPLICATION AND APPEALS PROCEDURE APPLICATIONS FOR ETHICAL APPROVAL The Institutional Research Ethics Board ethical committee will consider the following matters when reviewing applications for ethical approval, considering their relevance to the research project: The risk of physical, emotional, or reputational harm to research participants, and the steps that will be taken to minimize or mitigate these risks. The risk of physical or emotional harm to the researcher, and the steps that will be taken to minimize or mitigate these risks. The procedures for recruiting research participants and obtaining their informed consent, including the provision of participant information sheets and consent forms.

The university has an obligation to safeguard public funds and ensure that it delivers the assured value for mo ney to its students and other beneficiaries. The Tuition Fee Policy forms part of the university\u2019s Terms and Conditions and should be read in conjunction with them, for together they provide the comprehensive framework for the setting, payment, collection, and reconciliation of tuition fees. Course fees include all compulsory elements needed for students to meet the minimum learning outcomes of the course. In some courses, optional additional costs may be incurred. The purpose of this policy is to set out the tuition fee liability that applies to students upon enrolment on a course/programme of study. Scope This policy relates to: \u27a2 Student tuition fee liability This policy does not relate to: \u27a2 Non-refundable tuition fee deposits \u27a2 Accommodation fees 37 | P a g e Policy \u27a2 All students bear a personal liability for the tuition fee associated with any course/programme of study for which they enrol. \u27a2 All students must enrol for each successive year or another relevant part of their course/courses at MIT World Peace University no later than 30 days after the stating date of the respective course/courses). o Upon non -completion of enrolment by/before the prescribed deadline dates, students will be withdrawn from their ongoing course. Once withdrawn, the students\u2019 ID card will be deactivated following which they will not be able to attend lectures, use the libr ary, submit, or sit for assessments or take part in any other academic activity. \u27a2 The University has a ' fixed fee ' policy for tuition fee meaning that the fee charged at the beginning of the programme remains the same throughout that particular programme. \u27a2 The ' fixed fee ' policy will apply even if a student interrupts or repeats another year of study. \u27a2 It is the students\u2019 responsibility to ensure that they will be able to pay for their entire course duration prior to enrolment. \u27a2 Enrolment will not be permitted unless any/all outstanding debt(s) from the previous year has been paid in full or an instalment plan has been agreed upon by the university\u2019s Fee Team. \u27a2 IMPORTANT: Students are legally responsible for payment of their complete tuition fee themselves, whether they have an SLC loan or a sponsor. If the sponsor does not pay the university, or if the students find out that they are not eligible for a SLC loan, or they lose 38 | P a g e their eligibility for an SLC loan at any time after the commencement of the course, the students will be liable to pay their own fees for any/all periods of study that is not paid for by a sponsor or the SLC. This applies to all forms of undergraduate and postgraduate fee. \u27a2 Students who are considering discontinuing their programme of study are encouraged to first consult with the University for Advice and Guidance before making the final decision to leave. Further information on the range of support available can be found on the university website. \u27a2 In all cases, wherein a student withdraws from or discontinues their studies, or is granted a period of leave of absence from their studies, the date of withdrawal/discontinuation/leave of absence is accounted for by the university towards calculating the cumulative tuition fee liability. \u27a2 For students who are sponsored, in the event of the sponsor not making payment in respect of the tuition fees, the student will be personally liable for the payment. \u27a2 Students funded by the Student Loans Company (SLC) will be liable for payment of either 50% or 100% of the tuition fee loan, in line with SLC policy in case of discontinuation mid - programme. For undergraduate students starting in August, the liability will stand at 50% in case the withdrawal takes place before course commencement & remaining 50% will be liable after completion of 90 days from the course commencement date. \u27a2 The university reserves the right to take appropriate action against students who fail to pay their fees, or make satisfactory arrangements to pay on, or by the end of a set period after the starting date of their course. When to pay fees: Students either can make the full payment or can opt for the payment in instalments as per the fee payment schedule declared and published by the university. First Installment Fee will have to be paid in full for the seat to be confirmed in candidate \u2019s name (no parti al payments are permitted) . How to pay fees: 39 | P a g e The University is committed to offering a simplified payment experience, which is both secure and safe.

Awards Funding Amount: 25K to 3L Duration of Project: 6 months to 3 years (Progress evaluation after every 6 months) Selection Criteria The R&D Cell will issue a call for proposals once a year, and individual faculty or a group of faculties along with the student members can submit their applications. An innovation screening committee will be established to review the proposals according to a prede\ufb01ned process, and the committee will make recommendations or non-recommendations for individual projects. The endorsement of an innovation project will depend on the innovation funds resulting in a solution for current technical and social challenges that eventually leads to the generation of intellectual property that can be marketed and has potent ial for commercial success through technology transfer. Teams of students are also eligible to apply for innovation funds. The teams will be required to present their ideas before a panel of experts and industry sponsors, following a \u2018Shark Tank\u2019 model.

Alongside its undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, MIT -WPU also encourages its faculty members and academic staff to undertake consultancy projects with industry and other institutions. This not only expands and strengthens the research pro\ufb01le of MIT-WPU but also creates new knowledge and broadens the experience of faculty and staff members. This document provid es a formal framework to guide the implementation of this process. AIM OF THE DOCUMENT MIT-WPU aims to be a university that fosters innovation and is committed to adopting best practices in its engagement with external organizations. The university rec ognizes that consultancy work and external activity undertaken by its staff are crucial and valuable aspects of its operations. MIT-WPU believes that such activities are essential for knowledge exchange and can result in mutually bene\ufb01cial outcomes for both, the university and external organizations. To support its staff in the delivery of approved consultancy work, MIT -WPU has established a policy that outlines the procedures and guidelines to be followed. This policy is a part of the university's human resources management procedures and forms a part of the contract of employment for the academic staff. PURPOSE The objective of this policy is to establish the rules and regulations that govern consultancy and other external service s provided by the staff of MIT -WPU. MIT-WPU acknowledges the signi\ufb01cance of its staff engaging in consultancy for external organizations, particularly for the industry. MIT -WPU recognizes this as a vital medium through which knowledge and expertise can be shared with and from businesses and other external agencies, thereby promoting the development of mutually bene\ufb01cial relationships with these organizations. Thus, MIT -WPU promotes and supports its staff members to under take consultancy and similar work, as long as it does not contradict the interests of MIT -WPU. It is expected by MIT -WPU that external consultancy engagement will be undertaken with the highest levels of professionalism and integrity by staff members. MIT-WPU expects that the consultancy work will contribute to the development of mutually bene\ufb01cial relationships with external organizations, including industry bodies, and that it will further enhance the knowledge and expertise of staff members, thus supporting the overall development of MIT-WPU. The policy aims to provide guidance and support to staf f members in undertaking consultancy work in a way that is consistent with the interests of MIT-WPU and ensures transparency, ethical practice, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations. Benefits of engagement: External consultancy provides an opportunity for the staff members to increase their professional and/or academic competence and experience, and a chance for continuing professional education by working with industry. Engaging in external consultancy can help to create and su stain relationships between MIT -WPU and external organizations, leading to bene\ufb01ts such as increased research opportunities, student admission and placement, and ultimately contributing to knowledge exchange for the bene\ufb01t of the country. External consultancy can also generate additional income for the staff members and increased funding for MIT-WPU. MIT-WPU CONSULTANCY POLICY RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 24 www.mitwpu.edu.in APPLICABILITY MIT-WPU aims to promote and support consultancy work among its staff members in accordance with the University's employment policies and regulations. Academic staff are encouraged to engage in consultancy work that aligns with their respective disciplines and does not hinder their primary role within their department. This policy is applicable to all academic, academic -related, and administrative staff members of MIT-WPU and is to be adhered to in uniformity.

If issues are problematic, approval of the Pro-Vice Chancellor/Vice Chancellor shall be sought before \ufb01nal sign -off. If a client insists on an agreement on their terms, R&D will review the Client's terms and conditions, in consultation with the Legal Department of MIT-WPU, for acceptance or renegotiation. Any agreement outside of the approved standard terms and conditions can only be entered into after approval from MIT-WPU's management and shall be done by R&D. EARNINGS DISTRIBUTION MODEL The distribution model is based on income per consultancy agreement per \ufb01nancial year. Sr. No. Earnings PI & Team** MIT-WPU 1 Intellectual Consultancy 80% 20% 2 MIT-WPU Consultancy 70% 30% 3 Testing and Evaluation 60% 40% 4 Standardization and Calibration 60% 40% **The applicable income tax and other statutory taxes will be deducted from the staff's payment, and they will receive only the net amount after deductions. The payment cannot be given in cash or any other form for personal bene\ufb01t and will be paid only ele ctronically into the individual's salary bank account. The share mentioned is in addition to the individual's regular salary. Each Consultancy Agreement contract will have a unique price that will be determined on a case -by-case basis, taking into consideration the client and the nature of the project. The maximum consultancy income permissible for a staff member under the standard distribution model shall not exceed their total salary for the year, which includes basic pay and standard allowances like dearness allowance but does not include other payments such as ex-gratia, monetary or non-monetary awards. This limit applies in any \ufb01nancial year, and any amount exceeding this limit shall be deposited into MIT -WPU's Research Fund. The creation of teaching and academic materials as well as other publications such as books and articles in a consultancy project will be subject to MIT-WPU's Policy on Intellectual Property. 29 MIT-WPU C CLARIFICATIONS For all matters not covered in this document, as a general principle, Dean R&D / Director R&D may be approached for clari\ufb01cations required, if any. GENERAL All payments made for consultancy services must be processed through MIT -WPU's designated bank a ccount. This means that payments should be made in the name of MIT -WPU and not directly to individual faculty members. MIT-WPU will ensure compliance with statutory laws and distribute the appropriate share to the faculty/staff involved in the consultancy project. The client shall not be provided with a detailed breakdown of the consultancy charges, and only a lump sum \ufb01gure of the total consultancy charges may be quoted. Nevertheless, the working sheet must be kept as part of the internal records and may be subject to an internal audit as deemed necessary. The consultancy agreement must comply with the laws of India as per t he Standardized Terms and Conditions. However, in exceptional circumstances and with proper approvals, compliance with both local and international laws may be considered. The Principal Investigator (PI) is solely responsible for completing the project and delivering the agreed -upon deliverables. MIT-WPU only provides necessary support to the PI. After the completion of the project, the Principal Investigator (PI) shall provide a Final Project Completion Report (PCR) to the funding agency. Additionally, two copies of the report shall be submitted to the R&D Cell for record keeping. To ensure the project account can be closed by the Finance Department of MIT-WPU, it is important to obtain a Completion Certi\ufb01cate (CC) from the funding agency to con\ufb01rm the successful completion of the project. Testing and evaluation services can be provided to ful\ufb01ll the requirements of governmental and associated organizations, speci\ufb01c clients, and external educational institutions. MIT-WPU may provide Standardization and Calibration services in areas where the necessary facilities are available or can be expanded. It is recommended that these services be supported by regular calibration and standardization of the laboratory equipment used for these purposes. For signi\ufb01cant projects where the consultancy value exceeds Rs. 5 Lakhs (Rupees Five Lakhs only), payments may be accepted against agreed -upon milestones with appropriate prior approvals. However, for smaller projects or daily consultancy work, payments must be obtained in advance from the client(s). In exceptional situations where the assigned PI is unable to complete the consultancy work undertaken by MIT-WPU, MIT-WPU retains the authority to reassign the consultancy to another investigator. If completing the consultancy is deemed impossible or unfeasible by MIT-WPU, the Approver will address the matter with the client to close the project.

The project account will be handled by the faculty or principal investigator (PI), who will spend the funds as required. The institute's share should also be transferred. The requirement for a consultancy project/task/work can originate from the industry or other organizations concerned, or the faculty can approach the industry or other organizations. The faculty is expected to estimate the time and cost required to accompl ish the task. A proposal is then prepared by the principal investigator (PI). The budget for the proposal should be in one part and re\ufb02ect the project consultancy fee for the principal investigator (PI), co -PI, and other investigators, 50% overheads to MIT -WPU, and service tax on the total amount if applicable. Service tax is subject to periodic revision by the Government of India. Service tax is not applicable on projects if the funds are received in foreign currency. Expenses for equipment, supporting manpower, travel, and contingency must also be included in the budget, if necessary.

TESTING PROJECTS Testing refers to the process of assessing a component or product against established standards. This may include testing the strength of concrete in construction, soil compaction strength, pressure gauge calibration, and chemical identi\ufb01cation, drug ident i\ufb01cation, estimation, and evaluation of unknown species. MIT-WPU will undertake testing jobs if facilities are available, and if such testing does not interfere with any teaching or research work. Faculty may initiate testing jobs once a request is receive d. The overall procedure for operation of the testing project is similar to that of a consultancy project. GENERAL GUIDELINES Limitations: Involving Foreign Collaborators: Publications of Results: Performing regular testing tasks should be discouraged. Additionally, it is important to exercise caution and ensure that consultancy projects do not hinder the regular duties of faculty members. The proposals that involve foreign collaborators must comply with the National Laws, Rules, Regulations, and procedures in effect regarding funding support to each partner. Researchers who wish to publish technical or scienti\ufb01c papers based on the project 's research work should follow the sponsoring agency's guidelines and acknowledge the agency's assistance in the publications. If the research results are to be legally protected, the investigators should take necessary steps to secure legal protection for the research results before publishing them. External Consultants External consultants may be engaged to provide comprehensive services to clients, but their in Consul tancy Projects: Con\ufb02ict of Interest: Consultants: Exceptions: utilization will be limited. They will be entitled to receive a lump sum honorarium or fee, which should not exceed 30% of the total consultancy fee speci\ufb01ed in the Consultancy Projects Proposal. Consultants are required to disclose in writing to the Dean R&D any relationship they may have with the client funding the consultancy project or any vendor to whom payments are made from project funds, such as the involvement of immediate relatives, or any potential scope for dispro - portionate self -gain. A commi ttee will review such cases and advise the Dean R&D to ensure that there is no actual con\ufb02ict of interest, and that the consultant's involvement does not compromise their objectivity, integrity, or commitment to the Institute and the profession. Consultants are prohibited from using the name of the Institute or their af\ufb01liation with the Institute in a way that (i) implies that the Institute endorses or opposes a product or service provided by a pro\ufb01t, non- pro\ufb01t, or government entity, (ii) suggests that the Institute has conducted research or released research \ufb01ndings when it has not done so, or presents the results of Institute research in a misleading manner, or (iii) could be perceived as conveying the of\ufb01cial position of the Institute on any matter of public interest. Book royalty and honorarium for services like Expert Committee meetings, invited lectures, Ph.D. viva/evaluation, invited training programmes, organization of conferences/workshops are not considered part of the consultancy services. 43 C MIT-WPU RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 44 www.mitwpu.edu.in PREAMBLE MIT World Peace University, hereafter referred to as MIT-WPU/Institute, has been striving for the last 40 years to develop a pool of high -quality scienti\ufb01c and technical professionals and provide solutions to various challenging technological issues that may arise in different \ufb01elds. The Institute is supported by well - quali\ufb01ed faculty and highly skilled staff, committed to be coming a premier center of teaching, research, and extension in Engineering and Technology. The Institute fosters academic excellence, innovation, and encourages scholarship and research. The MIT World Peace University recognizes the value of intangible assets such as inventions, copyrights, know -how, designs, and other creative and innovative products resulting from the intellectual and scienti\ufb01c endeavors of its faculty and students, whic h provide a competitive advantage to the Institute. To provide guidance on the practices and rules regarding intellectual property rights (IPR), ownership, commercial exploitation, technology transfer, and con\ufb01dentiality requirements, the Institute has for mulated its intellectual property policy. The policy aims to create an environment conducive to curiosity -driven and market -driven research and development activities, as well as the creation of original works of authorship, for the bene\ufb01t of the Institute, its faculty, staff, students, research scholars, and external agencies. It should be emphasized that this IPR policy should be considered as a guide rather than a rigid regulation in the legal sense, given the constantly evolving landscape of the national IPR policy, and may be subject to modi\ufb01cations if necessary. This document, along with the accompanying addendum (Operating guidelines) and annexures (providing useful information on Patents and Copyright), is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the Intellectual Property (IP) management framework at MIT -WPU. PURPOSE The purpose of the IPR policy of MIT-WPU is to: The primary objective of MIT -WPU's intellectual property policy is to facilitate, encourage, promote and",

To provide guidance on the practices and rules regarding intellectual property rights (IPR), ownership, commercial exploitation, technology transfer, and con\ufb01dentiality requirements, the Institute has for mulated its intellectual property policy. The policy aims to create an environment conducive to curiosity -driven and market -driven research and development activities, as well as the creation of original works of authorship, for the bene\ufb01t of the Institute, its faculty, staff, students, research scholars, and external agencies. It should be emphasized that this IPR policy should be considered as a guide rather than a rigid regulation in the legal sense, given the constantly evolving landscape of the national IPR policy, and may be subject to modi\ufb01cations if necessary. This document, along with the accompanying addendum (Operating guidelines) and annexures (providing useful information on Patents and Copyright), is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the Intellectual Property (IP) management framework at MIT -WPU. PURPOSE The purpose of the IPR policy of MIT-WPU is to: The primary objective of MIT -WPU's intellectual property policy is to facilitate, encourage, promote and safeguard scienti\ufb01c inquiry, research pursuits and academic freedom of its faculty, researchers and students. The Institute aims to foster a culture of innovation that encourages the creation and development of intellectual property within its premises.; The policy aims to provide a clear understanding of the rights and responsibilities of the faculty, staff, and students regarding intellectual property and to protect the interests of the Institute and its members. One of the objectives of the MIT-WPU IPR policy is to establish a comprehensive management policy and procedural guidelines for converting the knowledge generated within the Institute to wealth. This involves the identi\ufb01cation, protection, management, and commercialization of intellectual property assets, such as patents, copyrights, and trademar ks, with the aim of generating income for the Institute and its members. The policy also includes guidelines for technology transfer, licensing agreements, and spin -off companies, as well as procedures for resolving disputes related to IPR. The primary objective of the IPR policy is to enable the Institute to make effective and bene\ufb01cial use of the intellectual property created by its members, in order to maximize the bene\ufb01ts to the inventors, the Institute, and the society as a whole. The aim is to establish the Institute as a leading academic research center that upholds the highest standards of scholarship and teaching. This can be achieved by disseminating the bene\ufb01ts of intellectual property generated at the Institute to the communi ty and society. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (POLICY AND GUIDELINES) OBJECTIVES The IPR policy of the Institute aims to: The Institute aims to protect and enhance the value of intellectual property created by its faculty, staff, and students during their tenure at the Institute. This will provide opportunities for wealth generation, alleviation of human suffering, and improvement of human life. The objective is to promote awareness and culture of IPR among the faculty, staff, and students of the Institute by implementing prudent IP management practices. Establish a centralized and comprehensive reference system to address all IPR related issues in a streamlined and ef\ufb01cient manner, making it easier for faculty, staff, and students to access infor mation and receive guidance. The IPR policy of the Institute aims to proactively create an environment that fosters the generation of new knowledge through research and innovations, while also aligning with the educational mission of the Institute. SCOPE This policy applies to all forms of intellectual property resulting from the intellectual and scienti\ufb01c pursuits of the following individuals: faculty members, staff, students, research scholars (both internal and external), individuals employed in sponsored research and consultancy projects, visiting scientists/professors/professionals who contribute to the teaching and research wor k conducted at the Institute, whether full -time or part -time, regardless of whether these rights are eligible for registration. The intellectual property generated from academic research encompasses patents, designs, copyright, know -how, and con\ufb01dential in formation. POLICY STATEMENT The Institute is dedicated to balancing the promotion, protection, management, and commercialization of intellectual property while also maintaining its core values of teaching, research, and community service. It acknowledg es the importance of commercializing and exploiting intellectual property for generating additional revenue for the Institute and offering bene\ufb01ts to its staff and students. However, the Institute also acknowledges the signi\ufb01cance of traditional academic v alues and expectations. DEFINITIONS Intellectual Property (IP) refers to intangible knowledge products and encompasses all types of results, conclusions, deductions, inventions, ideas, improvements, discoveries, enhancements, solutions, processes, modi\ufb01cations, know -how, data, and informatio n that are conceived, generated, made, or reduced to practice by the faculty, staff, students, research scholars, and other employees of the Institute. This includes designs, software programmes, genetically engineered microorganisms, business models, and copyrightable works that result from their intellectual output. IP is the result of research supported or sponsored by the Institute, industrial consulting, or other collaborative research and development efforts. Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) refers to the legal rights that are granted to individuals or entities for their creative and innovative works. These rights are derived from various forms of intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. IPR grants exclusive rights to the creators or owners of intellectual property, allowing them to contr ol the use, distribution, and commercialization of their creations. This ensures that they are able to bene\ufb01t \ufb01nancially from their work and encourages further innovation and creativity. Some examples of IPR include the following: Patents: These are legal protections granted to inventors for their new and useful inventions or discoveries. They give the inventor the exclusive right to manufacture, use, and sell the invention for a certain period. 45 C MIT-WPU RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 46 www.mitwpu.edu.in Trademarks: Copyrights: Trade Secrets: These are symbols, logos, or phrases used to identify and distinguish a particular product or service from others.

Trademarks protect the brand iden tity of a company or individual and prevent others from using similar marks that could confuse consumers. These are legal protections granted to authors, artists, and creators for their original works of expression, such as books, music, \ufb01lms, and software. Copyrights give the creator the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, and display their work. These are con\ufb01dential business information or practices that give a company a competitive advantage. Trade secret protection prevents others from using or disclosing secret information without permission. Overall, IPR plays a crucial role in protecting and incentivizing innovation and creativity by providing legal protections an d \ufb01nancial rewards for the creators and owners of intellectual property. Background information the term \"background information\" in a Collaborative Research and Development programme refers to the technical knowledge and expertise that is owned or controlled by the programme partners before the commencement of the programme. This information is typically in the same \ufb01eld as the programme's subject matter or in related \ufb01elds that are necessary for the successful execution of the programme. The term \"Institute Personnel\" as used in this policy document encompasses a wide range of individuals including but not limited to full-time and part -time faculty members, staff, students, research scholars (both internal and external), visiting scientists, professors, and other professionals who are employed or engaged by the institute. OWNERSHIP OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Whenever the Institute \ufb01les an application for ownership of intellectual property rights, it is require d to acknowledge and mention all individuals who have made signi\ufb01cant intellectual contributions to the creation or invention in question. These individuals must be identi\ufb01ed as inventors or creators in the application. Copyrights The ownership of copyright on all teaching and instructional materials created by employees of the Institute as part of any academic programmes or activities shall belong to the Institute. However, the author(s) of such materials shall retain the right to use the materials in their professional work. This clause does not apply to books, articles, monographs, speeches, and other works produced by the Institute staff members during research and teaching, using Institute resources. The Institute acknowledges and recognizes that the faculty members own the copyright to such traditional works of authorship. In situations where Institute employees have created copyrightable works, including software, using. signi\ufb01cant Institute resources, the Institute may require the employees to assign some or all of the copyright to such works. The extent to which the Institute's resources have been used to produce the copyrightable work will determine the extent of the assignment of the copyright. The Institute shall have ownership of the copyright of works created by non-Institute personnel who are engaged or associated with any Institute activity, regardless of whether Institute personnel have made intellectual contributions to such works or not. In cases where copyrightable works are created during sponsored or collaborative activities, the ownership of copyright shall be determined either in accordance with the terms and conditions related to intellectual property speci\ufb01ed in the contract governing such activity (if any), or through mutual consultations and agreement between the Institute and the sponsoring/collaborating agency. 47 www.mitwpu.edu.in In the case of a thesis, dissertation, or project report written by a student, the ownership of copyright shall be jointly held by the student and their guide. However, the Institute may demand the full assignment of the copyright in such cases. In cases where the Institute does not demand the assignment of copyright or where the copyright has not been assigned to the Institute, the Institute shall be entitled to a non -exclusive, non -transferable lic ense to use the work within the Institute for non-commercial educational and research purposes. Additionally, the Institute may possess a limited number of copies of the work for such purposes. Unless otherwise speci\ufb01ed in the original contract for the work, any copyrightable work that is generated as a work -for-hire shall normally belong to the Institute. If the Institute anticipates a potential \ufb01nancial gain from any copyrights, it may take steps to \ufb01le and protect such copyrights and share the result ing \ufb01nancial bene\ufb01ts with the creator(s) according to the terms and conditions established by the Institute. Institute - Supported Research All intellectual property rights arising from investigations conducted at the Institute using the Institute's resources shall belong to and be the exclusive property of the Institute, except in cases where such investigations are conduct - ed jointly with o ther institutions and agencies or are sponsored by an outside agency. Sponsored Research The intellectual property rights (IPR) of inventions resulting from research projects that are carried out on behalf of and fully funded by a sponsoring agency shall be registered jointly in the name of the Institute and the sponsoring agency if the cost of securing and maintaining the IPR registration is shared equally between the Institute and the sponsoring agency.

Institute - Supported Research All intellectual property rights arising from investigations conducted at the Institute using the Institute's resources shall belong to and be the exclusive property of the Institute, except in cases where such investigations are conduct - ed jointly with o ther institutions and agencies or are sponsored by an outside agency. Sponsored Research The intellectual property rights (IPR) of inventions resulting from research projects that are carried out on behalf of and fully funded by a sponsoring agency shall be registered jointly in the name of the Institute and the sponsoring agency if the cost of securing and maintaining the IPR registration is shared equally between the Institute and the sponsoring agency. However, if the sponsoring agency is not willing to share the costs of registration and maintenance, the IPR shall belong exclusively to the Institute. If the sponsoring agency is not willing to share the cost of securing and maintaining the IPR registration for jointly \ufb01led applications, the Institute may, at its discretion, \ufb01le the application with sole ownership and bear the entire cost of securing and protecting the IPR. In cases where the research project is only partially funded by the sponsoring agency or if there are multiple sponsors for the same project, the sharing of IPR shall be determined through mutual consultations and appropriate agreements between the Institute and the sponsoring agency(ies). If the sponsoring agency is an industry, they may choose one of the following options for sharing the IPR with the Institute: The Institute may enter into an agreement with the sponsoring industry where the ownership of IPR will rest with the industry. However, the industry will have to pay the Institute an initial lump sum and reasonable annual royalties for a speci\ufb01c period as recognition of the Institute's contribution to the project. The terms of ownership of the IPR will be governed by a speci\ufb01c prior agreement between the Institute and the sponsoring industry. The ownership of IPR rested in the sponsoring industry may be exclusive or non -exclusive. In case of exclusive ownership, if the industrial sponsor fails to exploit within a mutually agreed time limit, the Institute may permit third -party exploitation of the IPR. The Institute shall retain ownership of the IPR, but the industrial sponsor shall have the right to exploit the IPR either exclusively or non-exclusively. This right will be granted in exchang e for an initial lump sum payment, subsequent annual royalties for a speci\ufb01ed period, or other bene\ufb01ts to the Institute as mutually agreed upon. In cases of exclusive exploitation rights, if the industrial sponsor fails to exploit the IPR within an agreed -upon time limit, third -party exploitation may be permitted. The Institute shall retain user rights for the purposes of further research and development. The terms of ownership and exploitation rights will be governed by a speci\ufb01c prior agreement between the Institute and the sponsoring industry. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 Joint Research In the case of intellectual property resulting from joint research conducted by Institute personnel with external organizations/agencies/individuals, the ownership of the IP will be jointly shared by the Institute and the collaborators. The cost of \ufb01ling a nd maintaining the IPR as well as the revenue generated from its commercial exploitation will be shared by both parties according to an agreed -upon formula. If the collaborators do not agree to share the cost, the Institute may decide at its discretion to \ufb01le and maintain the IPR at its own expense. In such cases, the sharing of revenue resulting from the commercial exploitation of the IPR will be determined solely by the Institute. Technology Transfer The Institute will make all efforts to commercially exploit the IPR obtained, either solely or jointly with other agencies, to the fullest extent reasonably possible and without unnecessary delay. The marketing of the IPR will be conducted through technology transfer agreements, licensing (both exclusive and non-exclusive), and revenue -sharing models. The Institute will attempt to \ufb01nd potential licensees to commercially exploit the intellectual property (IP) that it owns outright. If the IP is jointly owned, the Institute will offer the \ufb01rst opportunity to commercially exploit it to the joint owners, regardless of whether the IP is protected by patents or not. This licensing agreement would require a lump sum payment as a technology transfer fee, as well as ongoing royalty payments for an agreed -upon period from the start of commercial exploitation. If the joint owner declines this option, the Institute will move forward with commercializing the IP in a manner it sees \ufb01t. If the other collaborating organization or industry does not undertake commercial exploitation within two years from the initial development of the technology, the Institute retains the right to license the use of the intellectual property to a third party. The Institute may support entrepreneurial activities among its staff by transferring ownership of an intellectual property to the inventor(s) or creator(s) of the property, through an agreement. This will enable the staff member s to market, protect, and license the intellectual property independently, with minimal involvement from the Institute. The Institute requires the assignee to pay all expenses related to patenting and licensing, as well as any royalties, equity, or other value received by the inventor(s) or creator(s). The Institute would make efforts to commercialize intellectual property, either through its own means or by hiring a Technology Management Agency to develop the IP created by its staff.

After a speci\ufb01ed period, the inventor(s) or creator(s) may request that the Institute transfer the rights to them. Revenue Sharing The sole applicant for any intellectual property (IP) generated at MIT-WPU will be the institute itself, and no sharing of revenue will occur, even if the IP is commercialized. However, in cases where the institute chooses to transfer the IP rights to the inventor(s)/creator(s), the inventor(s)/creator(s) will be required to reimburse the institute for all costs incurred in protecting, maintaining, marketing, and otherwise associated with the IP. 48 C MIT-WPU 49 www.mitwpu.edu.in Infringements, Damages, Liability, and Indemnity Insurance As a policy, the Institute will require any licensee to provide indemni\ufb01cation against any legal proceedings, including but not limited to those arising from manufacturing defects, production problems, design guarantees, and obligations related to upgrades and debugging, in any contract between the licensee and the Institute. The Institute will include an indemnity clause in agreements with licensees when transferring technology or copyrighted material, to protect its personne l. The Institute will also retain the right to decide whether or not to engage in any litigation concerning patents and license infringements. Conflict of Interest Inventors must disclose any con\ufb02icts of interest or potential con\ufb02icts of interest. If the inventor(s) or their immediate family have a stake in a licensee or potential licensee company, they must disclose the stake they or their immediate family have in the company. In the case of a license or an assignment of rights for a patent to a company where the inventor(s) have a stake, the approval of the IPR Cell will be required. Dispute Resolution If there are any disputes between the Institute and the inventors concerning the implementation of the IP policy, the aggrieved party can appeal to the Vice Chancellor of the Institute. The Institute will make efforts to address the concerns of the aggrieved party. However, the decision of the Chancellor will be \ufb01nal and binding in this matter. APPLICATION OF POLICY This policy is considered a part of the conditions of employment for every employee of the Institute, as well as a condition of enrollment and attendance for students at the Institute. The policy applies to all existing staff and students upon enrollment. Bottom of Form The Institute retains the right to amend the IPR Policy as necessary or deemed appropriate. All potential cre ators who use Institute -sponsored resources or participate in a sponsored research project must comply with this policy and accept the principles of intellectual property ownership outlined in this policy, unless an exception is approved in writing by the Institute. RIGHT TO REGULATE POLICY The IPR Cell is responsible for interpreting the policy, resolving disputes, and applying the policy. The cell may also recommend changes to the policy p eriodically to the Registrar and Vice Chancellor, who will make decisions on any suggested changes. The IPR policy may be reviewed every three years, or earlier if there is a signi\ufb01cant change in the national policy. LEGAL JURISDICTION As a policy, all ag reements signed by the Institute and any resulting disputes will be subject to the legal jurisdiction of the Court of Adjudication in Pune only. These agreements will be governed by the appropriate laws of India.

IP PROTECTION -SOME EXPLANATORY NOTES (To be read in conjunction with MIT-WPU IPR\u2013Annexure: some useful information on patents and copyright) Intellectual property can take various forms such as patents, industrial designs, trademarks, copyrights, con\ufb01dential information, technical know -how, mask works, processes, plans, speci\ufb01cations, guidelines, graphics, training materials, softwa re programmes, records, drawings, instruction guides, student materials, new techniques, algorithms, concepts, and more. To be protected by MIT World Peace University, the intangible product of the intellect must have potential for industrial application o r for enhancing the S&T knowledge base. A patent can be awarded for any invention that is capable of being commercially applied. To meet the patentability standards, the invention must satisfy the criteria of novelty, utility, and non -obviousness. Addition ally, there must be an inventive step, which refers to an innovation that is not apparent to a person with ordinary skill in the relevant \ufb01eld. The invention may pertain to a new product, an improvement to an existing product, or a new process of manufacturing an existing or new product. Design protection can be obtained for any prototype that in\ufb02uences the consumer's choice by appealing to their aesthetic sense. In simpler terms, design protection can be secured for the appearance, visual features, and overall look of the article. However, design protection is not available for functional features. Patents are intended to safeguard applied and extension research, while copyright law is designed to protect pure or fundamental research.

PROCEDURE FOR IP PROTECTION All patent and copyright applications (as per profo rma MIT -WPU/IPR -01 and MIT -WPU/IPR -02, respectively) must be sent to the Convener/Dean R&D through the IPR Cell via the Dean of the School or Director of the Center, regardless of whether the inventions have resulted from in - house projects or sponsored projects. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 52 MIT-WPU C RECORD KEEPING PROCEDURES All data and details produced by a creator during the creation of intellectual property should be meticulously documented in the relevant School/Centre, with speci\ufb01c emphasis on the following: Avoid using abbreviations or technical terms that are not commonly understood, unless they are explained in a table at the beginning or end of the book. This will ensure that readers who are not familiar with the terminology can understand the text without confusion or dif\ufb01culty. Important information such as data, descriptions, or experiments that pertain to signi\ufb01cant inventions or discoveries should be attributed and documented by the individual(s) responsible for the project, such as the creator, supervisor, or coordinator. I. Any changes that need to be made should be indicated by crossing out the deleted content and labeling it as \"cancelled\". The corrected data, clearly marked as such, should be entered immediately below and authenticated by the creator with their initials an d the date. II. In cases where new products are created or produced by a new method, it is advisable to preserve samples and take photographs for record keeping purposes. All photographs should be dated and signed by the creator on the back. When Should Faculty Approach IPR Cell To Discuss a Possible Patent? MIT-WPU has established an exclusive IPR Cell to manage intellectual property rights. Faculty members who have created potential intellectual property while employed by MIT-WPU can approach the IPR Cell advisor to arrange a discussion at a mutually convenient time. It is recommended that this discussion occurs well in advance of the idea maturing into a process or product. If the invention is only in the conception stage, it is possible to \ufb01le a provisional speci\ufb01cation, which must be followed up with a complete speci\ufb01cation within 12 months; otherwise, the patent application will be considered abandoned. However, if the inventor has an innovative product that can be immediately marketed, a complete speci\ufb01cation can be lod ged right away. EVALUATION OF PATENT/COPYRIGHT APPLICATIONS The IPR Cell will receive and examine each patent/copyright application submitted through an Invention Disclosure Form/Copyright Disclosure form according to the MIT-WPU/IPR -01/MIT -WPU/IPR -02 proforma. Additionally, an IPR facilitation request (MIT -WPU/IPR -03) must be included. The committee may request assistance from other professors who are experts in the relevant \ufb01eld to conduct an initial evaluation of proposals for their potential patentability. These domain experts will be required to sign a non-Disclosure agreement according to the MIT -WPU/IPR -04 proforma and a No Con\ufb02ict -of-Interest Form according to the MIT -WPU/IPR -05 profor ma before being granted access to the proposal. If necessary, the inventors may be asked to present their case before the IPR Cell. If the Cell recommends \ufb01ling for patents, the Convener of the IPR Cell will facilitate the application through one of the a pproved attorneys from the panel maintained by the IPR Cell. ASSISTANCE IN FILLING THE PROFORMA Once the IPR Cell approves protecting the Intellectual output, a patent Attorney shall be identi\ufb01ed by the Cell for drafting the IP application. The following aspects need to receive attention: Objective of the invention: What problem is the inventor trying to solve? What are the issues involved? The objective of the invention should clearly state the problem that the inventor is trying to solve. This should be a concise statement that identi\ufb01es the issues involved in the invention. For example, the objective of the invention might be to develop a more ef\ufb01cient method for processing data or to create a new device that solves a speci\ufb01c problem in a particular industry. 53 www.mitwpu.edu.in What prior art searches have been made?

Who are responsible for administration of IPRs in the country? The Controller General of Patents, Designs, and Trademarks is responsible for overseeing patents, designs, and trademarks. This department operates under the Ministry of Industry's Department of Industrial Development. Copyright, on the other hand, falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Human Resource Development. 4. What is a patent? A patent is a legal monopoly which is granted for a limited time to the owner of an invention. Patent rights A patent is a legal right granted by the state that provides a limited -time monopoly to the owner of an invention. Simply possessing a patent does not automatically give the owner the right to use or exploit the patented invention; other laws and regulations, such as those governing health and safety, food and drugs, and inheritance, may also affect these rights. Patent rights can be sold, licensed, inherited, abandoned, and may even be subject to revocation by the state in certain circumstances, both before and aft er the grant of the patent. Additionally, there are global patents available for international protection. 55 www.mitwpu.edu.in 5. What is the distinction between patented invention and know -how? According to the law, a patent speci\ufb01cation does not have to disclose all the information required for the commercial exploitation of the invention. Therefore, the information provided in a patent speci\ufb01cation may not be suf\ufb01cient for commercialization purposes. In contrast, known -how refers to all the information necessary for commercializing an invention, such as details of production methods and design drawings needed to set up a production plant. If known -how is developed around an existing patent and subsequently commercialized without the patentee's agreement, it may be considered an infringement of the patent unless the patentee has agreed to such commercialization on mutually. Agreed terms. 6. How is an invention interpreted? For an invention to be considered patentable, it must not only be novel, but also involve an inventive step. This means that the invention must not be obvious to a person skilled in the relevant \ufb01eld, taking into consideration the state of the art, but disregarding unpublished pending patent applications. However, simplicity is not necessarily a barrier to securing a patent. The means of achieving the desired outcome may be simple and common, but an inventive step may still exist if the inventor has developed a variant that produces more useful results. It does not matter whether the invention was developed by accident, as long as it involves some level of inventive step. Whether or not it has been in the meantime sold or licensed. There is no such thing as What are patentable inventions under the patent Act, 1970? Invention means any new and useful: Art, process, method, or manner of manufacture Machines, apparatus, or another article Substances produced by manufacture and included any new and useful improvements of any of them and an alleged invention. However, inventions claiming substances intended for use; or capable of being used, as food or as medicine of drug or relating to subst ances prepared or produced by chemical processes (including alloys, optical glass, semi -conductors, and inter -metallic compounds) are not patentable. 7. How is the novelty of and invention determined? The novelty of an invention is determined based on the knowledge that is available globally, including in India, at the time of \ufb01ling the patent application. This means that the invention should not have been known or disclosed to the public anywhere in the world before the \ufb01ling date of the patent application . 8. What are the types of inventions which are not patentable? An invention which is frivolous, or which claims anything obviously contrary to well established natural laws e.g., different types of perpetual motion or machines which violate the third law of thermodynamics. An invention that has a primary or intended use which is contrary to law or morality or injurious to public health is not considered patentable. For example, a process for preparing a beverage that involves the use of a carcinogenic substance, even if the beverage has a higher nourishment value, would not be considered patentable. The mere discovery of a scienti\ufb01c principle or the form ulation of an abstract theory is not patentable. For example, the discovery of the Raman Effect, which is a scienti\ufb01c principle, cannot be patented. However, an invention that makes use of scienti\ufb01c principle or theory can be patented if it meets the criteria of novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability. To be patentable, the invention must involve an inventive step. Thus, the mere discovery of any new property or",

Thus, the mere discovery of any new property or new use of a known substance or the mere use of a known process, machine or apparatus is not considered patentable, unless such a known process results in a new product or employs at least one new reactant. In other words, there must be some degree of i nnovation and improvement in the known substance or process to be eligible for a patent. A substance that is created by simply mixing existing substances together, resulting only in the combination of their properties, is not patentable. The same applies to a process for creating such a substance. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 56 MIT-WPU C The mere arrangement, rearrangement, or duplication of features of known devices, each functioning independently of one another in a known way, is not considered an invention and hence not patentable. In other words, a patent cannot be granted for a combin ation of known features that does not result in any new or improved function or technical effect. A method or process of testing applicable during the process of manufacture for rendering the machine, apparatus, or other equipment more ef\ufb01cient. A method of agriculture or horticulture. Any process for medicinal, surgical, curative, prophylactic or other treatment of human \u2018beings, or any process for a simila r treatment of animals or plants. Invention relating to atomic energy. 9. When should an application for a patent be \ufb01led? a) It is important to \ufb01le a patent application as soon as possible, rather than waiting until the invention is fully developed for commercial use. Filing an application with a provisional speci\ufb01cation can help establish priority for the applicant. Delay in \ufb01ling an application can lead to risks such as other inventors applying for a patent for the same invention before the \ufb01rst inventor, or inadvertent publica tion of the invention by the inventor or others independently. What are the essential patent documents to be generated and submitted by a potential patentee? b) There are two types of patent documents usually known as patent speci\ufb01cation namely. Provisional speci\ufb01cation Complete speci\ufb01cation PROVISIONAL SPECIFICATION To add to the previous answer, a complete speci\ufb01cation is a detailed description of the invention and how to make and use it. It should include claims that de\ufb01ne the scope of the invention for which protection is sought. The claims must be clear, concise, and supported by the description. The complete speci\ufb01cation must be \ufb01led within 12 months from the date of \ufb01ling the provisional speci\ufb01cation, and failure to do so will result in the abandonment of the application. It's also worth noting that while a provisional speci\ufb01cation may be \ufb01led without any claims, the complete speci\ufb01cation must include at least one claim de\ufb01ning the scope of the invention. The claims must be carefully drafted to ensure that they are not overly broad or vague, which could result in the patent being challenged or invalidated later. The provisional speci\ufb01cation is not a permanent and independent scienti\ufb01c cum legal document. It is a temporary document \ufb01led to establish priority of the invention and to secure a \ufb01ling date. Amendments to the provisional speci\ufb01cation can be made at any time before \ufb01ling a complete speci\ufb01cation. However, once a complete speci\ufb01cation is \ufb01led, amendments to the provisional speci\ufb01cation are not allowed. COMPLETE SPECIFICATION To obtain a patent, it is necessary to submit a Complete Speci\ufb01cation. This speci\ufb01cation should include informa - tion about the \ufb01eld to which the invention relates, the background of the prior art, any drawbacks related to the previously known details of the invention, the best way of carrying out the invention, and claims that de\ufb01ne the scope of the invention. The Complete Speci\ufb01cation should provide enough information to enable a person skilled in the art to work on the invention without requiring assistance from the inventor. 57 www.mitwpu.edu.in 10. What are the criteria for naming inventors(s) in an application for patent? The naming of inventors is normally decided based on the following criteria: All persons who have contributed towards the conception or reduction to practice of at least one claim of the invention should be named as an inventor. Intellectual contribution towards the results of the research work leading to a patent is not suf\ufb01cient for being named as an inventor. Contribution towards the conception or reduction to practice of at least one claim of the invention is necessary. A person who has not contributed to the conception or reduction to practice of at least one claim of the invention is not entitled to be included as an inventor. A person who provides only routine assistance, such as making dr awings or constructing a prototype under the direction of an inventor, is not entitled to be named as an inventor. Dif\ufb01culties may arise in determining who should be named as an inventor, and to avoid such situations,",

Dif\ufb01culties may arise in determining who should be named as an inventor, and to avoid such situations, it is important for all researchers to maintain clear and accurate records of their work in a consecutively numbered diary, with entries signed by both the researchers and their team leader. 11. Can a published or disclosed invention be patented? To clarify, if an inventor publicly discloses their invention before \ufb01ling a patent application, it could potentially prevent them from obtaining a patent. This is because one of the requirements for obtaining a patent is that the invention must be new and non -obvious at the time the patent application is \ufb01led. If the invention has already been publi cly disclosed, it may no longer meet the novelty requirement. Therefore, it is generally recommended that inventors do not disclose their inventions publicly before \ufb01ling a patent application. Instead, they should keep their invention con\ufb01dential and \ufb01le a patent application as soon as possible. If an inventor does choose to disclose their invention before \ufb01ling a patent application, they may still be able to obtain a patent if they \ufb01le the application within a certain time frame. In the United States, for example, inventors have one year from the date of the \ufb01rst public disclosure to \ufb01le a patent application. If an inventor does obtain a patent, they should include the patent number and date in any subsequent publications or disclosures related to the invention. This provides information to the public about the existence of the patent and its scope of protection. 12. What is considered the date of patent? The date on which the complete speci\ufb01cation is \ufb01led is considered the date of patent, and it is a crucial date for determining the legal protection of the invention covered by the patent. The term of the patent is calculated from this date, and it is from this date that the exclusive rights of the patent holder begin. 13. What is the term of a patent in Indian system? The term of every patent in India is 20 years, starting from the date of \ufb01ling of the patent application, regardless of whether it was \ufb01led with a provisional or complete speci\ufb01cation. However, for applications \ufb01led under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), the term of 20 years begins from the international \ufb01ling date. 14. How does one keep a patent in force for the full patent terms? To maintain a patent's validity, the patent holder is required to pay renewal fees at regular intervals. If the renewal fees are not paid, the patent will expire and will no longer be legally enforceable. Once a patent has expired, the invention becomes open to the public, and anyone can use, manufacture or sell the invention without permission from the original patent holder. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 58 MIT-WPU C 15. What is expected from a patentee? As per Indian patent law, it is expected that a patent holder should work their invention in India on a commercial scale and without any unnecessary delay. A patent is not granted simply to provide a monopoly to the patent holder for importing the patented product into India. This means that a patent holder ca nnot simply hold onto their invention and prevent others from using it. The intention behind granting a patent is to promote innovation and encourage the progress of technology, and to ensure that the invention is being utilized for the bene\ufb01t of society. 16. What is the nature of the information needed while consulting a patent attorney? When working with a patent agent or attorney to \ufb01le a patent application, it is important to provide them with a clear and comprehensive explanation of the invention. This may include information about the history of the invention, including where the idea came from and how it was developed. Any early failures or prototypes may also be relevant to understanding the inventive step involved in the invention. It is important to highlight what you believe to be the most central and inventive aspect of the invention, as well as any similar prior inventions that may exist. If you have developed an improved version of a competitor's product, it is important to disclose this information to the patent agent. Honesty and transparency in these matters will help the patent agent to draft claims and speci \ufb01cations that accurately re\ufb02ect the invention and avoid any potential for excessive claims that could be rejected. By providing your patent agent with a comprehensive understanding of your invention, including its history, inventive elements, and any prio r inventions or improvements, they will be better equipped to draft a strong patent application that maximizes the protection of your invention. In order to \ufb01le a strong patent application, it is important to provide a detailed description of how the inve ntion can be practically used, as well as any test results or trials conducted",

This includes any failures or defects encountered during testing, as well as any alternative ways of using the invention or potential substitutes for its parts. It may be worthwhile to draft the patent application in such a way that it covers a broad range of alternatives, including less satisfactory options, to prevent competitors from marketing subpar products that could tarnish the reputation of the entire product genre. During the patent application process, it is import ant to respond quickly and accurately to any queries from the patent agent. This will help to keep the application on track and save time and money. As the inventor, it is also important to keep the patent agent informed of any new developments or improvem ents made to the invention, as well as any new competitors that may arise. This will help the patent agent to draft a strong and effective patent application that accurately re\ufb02ects the invention and provides maximum protection. 59 www.mitwpu.edu.in 17.

To communicate the sound recording to the public Explanation: For the purpose of this section, a copy which has been sold once shall be deemed to be a copy already in circulation. 19. How is a computer de\ufb01ned for the purpose of copyright? Computers include any electronic or similar device having information processing capabilities. 20. What is the de\ufb01nition of a computer programme? A computer programme refers to a sequence of instructions, expressed in various forms such as words, codes, schemes or other formats, that enables a computer to perform a speci\ufb01c task or achieve a particular result. This sequence of instructions may be stored on a machine -readable medium, such as a hard drive, USB drive or other similar storage device, and can be executed by a computer processor to perform various functions or tasks. In essence, a computer programme is a collection of instructions that a computer can follow to perform a speci\ufb01c task or series of tasks. 21. What is the term of a copyright? The term of copyright protection for a literary work published during the author's lifetime is the life of the author plus 60 years. This means that the copyright protection lasts for the entire lifetime of the author and for 60 years after their death. The term of copyright protection for cinematographic \ufb01lms, records, photographs, posthumous publications, anonymous publications, works of government, and international agencies is 60 years from the beginning of the calendar year following the year in which the work was published. This means that copyright protection lasts for 60 years from the year after the publication year. The term of copyright protection for broadcasting is 25 years from the beginning of the calendar year following the year in which the broadcast was made. This means that copyright protection lasts for 25 years from the year after the year in which the broadcast was made. 61 www.mitwpu.edu.in IPR POLICY IPR is a general term covering patents, registered design, trademarks, copyright, and layout design of integrated circuits, trade secrets, geographical indicators, and anti-competitive practices in contractual licenses. The Intellectual Property could be protected in the form of: Patent (to be registered) , Design Registrations (to be registered) , Trademark (registered or otherwise) , Copyright refers to the legal protection granted to the creators of original works of authorship, such as literary, artistic, and musical works, in various forms including registered or unregistered. In the context of the Institute, it may include plans, speci\ufb01cations, guidelines, graphics, training materials, software programmes, records, drawings, instruction guides, student materials, new techniques, algorithms, concepts, and other forms of creative expression. Con\ufb01dential information and technical know -how may also be protected under copy right law if they are embodied in original works of authorship. Mask works, which are designs used to create semiconductor chips, may also be protected under copyright law. Additionally, copyright protection may extend to the processes used to create works of authorship, such as the techniques used to produce a particular type of artwork or the algorithms used to generate computer programmes. Intellectual Property (IP) refers to intangible creations of the mind, such as inventions, ideas, designs, software programmes, and other forms of knowledge. It includes all results, conclusions, deductions, improvements, discoveries, solutions, processes, modi\ufb01cations, data, and information generated or produced by the faculty, staff, students, research scholars, and other employees of the Institute. IP is the result of research activities supported or sponsored by the Institute, industrial consulting, or other forms of joint research and development work. The ownership of IP resulting from such activities is determined by the Institute's IP policy. A patent application accompanied by a provisional application does not provide legal rights to the applicants. However, it is a crucial document that establishes the earliest ownership of an invention. This can be important in cases where multiple parties claim ownership of an invention. The provisional application establishes the priority date of the invention, which can be crucial in determining who has the right to \ufb01le a patent application \ufb01rst. SALIENT FEATURES OF IPR AND SERVICES PROVIDED BY IPR CELL RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 MIT-WPU C EXCEPTIONS FOR PATENT: To clarify, inventions that claim substances that are intended for use as food, medicine, or drugs, or that are capable of being used as such, are not patentable. Similarly, inventions that relate to substances that are prepared or produced by chemical processes, including alloys, optical glass, semi -conductors, and inter -metallic compounds, are also not patentable. WHETHER PATENT CAN BE REVOKED: Since a patent is granted by the state, it can also be revoked by the state under certain circumstances, even after it has been granted. It's important to note that a patent can be revoked by the state regardless of whether it has been sold or licensed in the meantime. CONTEST/CONFLICT WITH SPONSORING AGENCY: If the sponsoring agency does not cooperate in \ufb01ling a joint intellectual property rights (IPR) application, the Institute may choose to \ufb01le the application on its own with complete ownership and will bear all costs associated with securing and protecting the IPR. Copyright law protects pure or basic research, whereas patents seek to protect applied and extended research. If the intellectual property results from joint research carried out by Institute personnel and external organizations/ agencies/individuals, the ownership of the IP will be shared jointly by the Institute and the collaborators. In such cases, the Institut e will have the \ufb01rst right to commercially exploit the joint IP, regardless of whether it has been formally protected by patent(s) or not. IP COUNSELLING: The IPR cell will provide guidance and support to potential inventors of intellectual products and will assist the Institute in identifying the potential for IPR. If the cell recommends \ufb01ling for patents, the Convener/Dean R&D through the IPR cell will process the application through an approved attorney from the panel maintained by the IPR cell.

If any copyrightable work is created during sponsored or collaborative activities, ownership of the copyright will be determined by the terms and conditions outlined in the relevant contract or through mutual agreement with the sponsoring/collaborating agency. All faculty members, staff, students, research scholars (internal and external), visiting scientists, professors, and other professionals, whether full-time or part -time, can avail themselves of the services provided by the IPR cell. MIT -WPU has established sy stems and mechanisms to facilitate the commercial exploitation of the knowledge generated at the Institute under the provisions of the IPR regime in the country. SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE IPR CELL: It is crucial to respond promptly and accurately to queries from the patent agent both during the initial search and throughout the patent application process. This will facilitate the progress of the patent application and potentially save money. The IPR cell will periodically suggest patentable technologi es to potential licensing agencies, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), and other \ufb01nancial institutions, encouraging them to invest in venture capital for new technologies. 63 www.mitwpu.edu.in Is it possible to utilize the services of MIT -WPU IPR Cell to apply for a patent and get it granted? Certainly, I understand. The IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) Cell at MIT -WPU is responsible for assisting faculty members, research associates, research scholars, students, and other researchers working at MIT -WPU in obtaining patents for their inventio ns. In what proportion would the expenditure to be incurred for getting the patent granted be shared between MIT -WPU and the inventors? To clarify, if an inventor processes their patent application through MIT-WPU IPR Cell and MIT-WPU is designated as the assignee for the granted patent, then MIT-WPU is responsible for paying the fees associated with the various stages of the patent application process. In this case, the inventor is not required to pay any fees. If the expenditure to be incurred for the patenting process is fully borne by MIT-WPU, what will be royalty share for inventors after the patent is granted and we go for commercialization? As MIT-WPU is the sole applicant, there is no revenue sharing model, even for commercialized patents. Can you help us with the complete rules and regulations of the patent application and regulations followed by the MIT -WPU IPR Cell? Please go through the links \u2018frequently asked questions\u2019 and \u2018IPR Policy\u2019 under \u201cIPR Cell\u201d link at MIT-WPU Website. Is it possible to apply for a patent as an individual without help from MIT -WPU? To put it another way, if the invention is the result of work conducted by a researcher during their time at MIT-WPU and if the facilities provided by MIT -WPU were utilized in the creation of the invention, then it is expected that the inventor will \ufb01le their patent application through the MIT -WPU IPR Cell and designate MIT -WPU as the assignee. If the patent application is not processed through MIT -WPU IPR Cell, will MIT -WPU still \ufb01nancially support the patenting process? To rephrase, if the inventor chooses not to apply for a patent through the MIT-WPU IPR Cell, then MIT-WPU will not assume any responsibility for the costs associated with the patenting process. What is the documentation to be submitted to IPR Cell and what is the mode of submission, when one makes a beginning with patenting his invention? The Inventor is required to submit their proposal in the format of an Invention Disclosure Form (IDF) when making their proposal. It's important to note that the format of the IDF differs depending on whether it is for a patent or a design registration. The blank IDF for patent or design registration can be downloaded from the IPR Cell link on the MIT -WPU website. It's worth noting that there have been instances where Inventors have submitted Forms 1, 2, 3, and 5 of the Indian Patents Act 1970 as part of their proposal. However, it's important to remember that these forms are not required to be submitted to the IPR Cell. Instead, only the IDF is necessary for submitting the proposal. If the proposal is for a design registration, the Inventors must enter into an \"Agreement on Designs\" with MIT -WPU on a non -judicial stamp paper worth Rs. 20. A template for the agreement can be downloaded from the IPR Cell link on the MIT -WPU website. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ) RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 MIT-WPU C Which are the points which need particular attention, while \ufb01lling in the Invention Disclosure Form (IDF) for patents? The following points in IDF require particular attention: Point 8: General area of the patent: Please be speci\ufb01c.

The policy encompasses all forms of research that involve human participants, their tissues, or data, and should also be applied more broadly to activities such as enterprise and innovation, or service evaluation and audit, where ethical issues may arise. These policies are applicable to all research conducted by MIT-WPU's faculty and students. For studies that have obtained external ethical approval, there is no need to repeat the process. The appropriate University Ethics Committee must be informed and provided with a copy of the approval. The Ethics Committee will con\ufb01rm that no additional approval is necessary for the study. This policy is applicable to all individuals conducting research either within the University or on behalf of it. This includes staff, individuals with honorary University appointments, visiting researchers, undergraduate and postgraduate students, as well as visiting scholars and students. When a research project is being carried out by academics from multiple institutions, the lead institution (usually the institution where the Principal Investigator is employed) should seek the relevant ethical clearance for the project, and other partner institutions should be informed of any outcomes and issues. PURPOSE The aim of this policy and procedure is to establish and promote the highest ethical standards in academic research. The University is dedicated to safeguarding the rights, dignity, safety, and privacy of research subjects, as well as the well -being of animals, and ensuring environmental protection. Additionally, the University is committed to minimizing health and safety risks for researchers and upholding their academic freedom. The Institutional Ethics Committee of MIT-WPU will evaluate and approve all research proposals involving human participants, taking into account the welfare and safety of actual and potential research participants. The goals of research, no matter how important, should never be prioritized over the health and well -being of the research subjects. GUIDELINES Researchers af\ufb01liated with MIT-WPU must seek approval from the Ethics Committee. The ethical review process should ensure adherence to the following policy documents of MIT-WPU. a. Policy for Promotion of Research b. Plagiarism Policy c. Patent Policy d. Consultancy Policy ETHICS COMMITTEE 77 www.mitwpu.edu.in The University mandates an ethical review of all research projects that involve primary research with human subjects (or their data), regardless of funding source. In most cases, a review would be conducted by a Research Ethics Committee. Projects involving living persons, human tissues, or data related to recently deceased persons, as well as projects involving animals (including animals living in their natural habitats), must have genuine research, educational, or training purpose. Ethical approval is required for all research involving human participants, human material, or human data. Howe ver, research that uses information about human participants that is publicly and lawfully available, such as census data, population statistics, court reports, and personal letters or diaries in public libraries, is exempt from this requirement. The University has a Code of Ethics for Research that includes funda mental principles to protect human participants. The University requires that all research falling under this policy must adhere to the Code of Ethics and its fundamental principles. The University's policies,",

Projects involving living persons, human tissues, or data related to recently deceased persons, as well as projects involving animals (including animals living in their natural habitats), must have genuine research, educational, or training purpose. Ethical approval is required for all research involving human participants, human material, or human data. Howe ver, research that uses information about human participants that is publicly and lawfully available, such as census data, population statistics, court reports, and personal letters or diaries in public libraries, is exempt from this requirement. The University has a Code of Ethics for Research that includes funda mental principles to protect human participants. The University requires that all research falling under this policy must adhere to the Code of Ethics and its fundamental principles. The University's policies, committees, and sub -committees must consider the relevant professional ethical codes and research sponsor policies. If there is a difference in ethical standards between the University policy and the relevant professional body or research sponsor, the committees should apply the highest standard of ethical practice. Research ethics committees should be appropriate to the disciplinary mix of research they will review, comply with speci\ufb01c funding or professional body requirements, and comply with relevant legislative requirements. They should also consider the anticipated volume of work. Every research ethics committee should not only take the responsibility of reviewing and approving all research within its jurisdiction but also create and endorse research ethics toolkits. These toolkits should include standard consent forms, participant information sheets, and protocols for ensuring security, con\ufb01dentiality, anonymization, and retention o f data. It is essential for all research ethics committees to maintain detailed records of their proceedings and decisions. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 MIT-WPU C APPLICATION AND APPEALS PROCEDURE APPLICATIONS FOR ETHICAL APPROVAL The Institutional Research Ethics Board ethical committee will consider the following matters when reviewing applications for ethical approval, considering their relevance to the research project: The risk of physical, emotional, or reputational harm to research participants, and the steps that will be taken to minimize or mitigate these risks. The risk of physical or emotional harm to the researcher, and the steps that will be taken to minimize or mitigate these risks. The procedures for recruiting research participants and obtaining their informed consent, including the provision of participant information sheets and consent forms. The rationale for using observation or covert surveillance, or any other methods that may not be transparent to research participants. The measures that will be taken to ensure the security and con\ufb01dentiality of personal data and any human tissues or artefacts collected for the project, particularly those that will be stored or processed off-site. The arrangements for the retention, anonymization, and disposal of personal data, artefacts, or tissues at the end of the project, or as required by research sponsors or legal provisions. The procedures for debrie\ufb01ng research participants, particularly in cases where the research may have caused them distress. The procedures for reporting and dealing with any adverse reactions to the research project. The measures that will be taken to ensure that appropriate Ethical Board checks are conducted when researchers are working in settings where children or vulnerable adults may be present. If ethical approval is not granted or if signi\ufb01cant modi\ufb01cations are required for the proposed research, the Institutional Research Ethics Board must provide detailed written feedback to the applicant. In the case of research students, the feedback must also be provided to their Director of Studies or Lead Supervisor, as appropriate. If the issue cannot be resolved informally, applicants have the right to appeal. APPEALS If there are statutory requirements that specify different procedures for appeals, these will take precedence over the appeals procedures outlined in this Policy. Researchers who are bound by their own professional code of conduct should be aware that their own ethics policies may be more rigorous than those outlined in this Policy, and they must comply with their professional codes. Failure to comply with ethics approval may be deemed as serious professional misconduct, which the university is obligated to report to the researcher's professional body. 79 www.mitwpu.edu.in INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH ETHICS BOARD The university shall establish an Institutional Research Ethics Board to ensure that research activities conducted by researchers are fully compliant with the university's regulations on research ethics and the protectio n of human and non- human subjects involved in research.

The university has an obligation to safeguard public funds and ensure that it delivers the assured value for mo ney to its students and other beneficiaries. The Tuition Fee Policy forms part of the university\u2019s Terms and Conditions and should be read in conjunction with them, for together they provide the comprehensive framework for the setting, payment, collection, and reconciliation of tuition fees. Course fees include all compulsory elements needed for students to meet the minimum learning outcomes of the course. In some courses, optional additional costs may be incurred. The purpose of this policy is to set out the tuition fee liability that applies to students upon enrolment on a course/programme of study. Scope This policy relates to: \u27a2 Student tuition fee liability This policy does not relate to: \u27a2 Non-refundable tuition fee deposits \u27a2 Accommodation fees 37 | P a g e Policy \u27a2 All students bear a personal liability for the tuition fee associated with any course/programme of study for which they enrol. \u27a2 All students must enrol for each successive year or another relevant part of their course/courses at MIT World Peace University no later than 30 days after the stating date of the respective course/courses). o Upon non -completion of enrolment by/before the prescribed deadline dates, students will be withdrawn from their ongoing course. Once withdrawn, the students\u2019 ID card will be deactivated following which they will not be able to attend lectures, use the libr ary, submit, or sit for assessments or take part in any other academic activity. \u27a2 The University has a ' fixed fee ' policy for tuition fee meaning that the fee charged at the beginning of the programme remains the same throughout that particular programme. \u27a2 The ' fixed fee ' policy will apply even if a student interrupts or repeats another year of study. \u27a2 It is the students\u2019 responsibility to ensure that they will be able to pay for their entire course duration prior to enrolment. \u27a2 Enrolment will not be permitted unless any/all outstanding debt(s) from the previous year has been paid in full or an instalment plan has been agreed upon by the university\u2019s Fee Team. \u27a2 IMPORTANT: Students are legally responsible for payment of their complete tuition fee themselves, whether they have an SLC loan or a sponsor. If the sponsor does not pay the university, or if the students find out that they are not eligible for a SLC loan, or they lose 38 | P a g e their eligibility for an SLC loan at any time after the commencement of the course, the students will be liable to pay their own fees for any/all periods of study that is not paid for by a sponsor or the SLC. This applies to all forms of undergraduate and postgraduate fee. \u27a2 Students who are considering discontinuing their programme of study are encouraged to first consult with the University for Advice and Guidance before making the final decision to leave. Further information on the range of support available can be found on the university website. \u27a2 In all cases, wherein a student withdraws from or discontinues their studies, or is granted a period of leave of absence from their studies, the date of withdrawal/discontinuation/leave of absence is accounted for by the university towards calculating the cumulative tuition fee liability. \u27a2 For students who are sponsored, in the event of the sponsor not making payment in respect of the tuition fees, the student will be personally liable for the payment. \u27a2 Students funded by the Student Loans Company (SLC) will be liable for payment of either 50% or 100% of the tuition fee loan, in line with SLC policy in case of discontinuation mid - programme. For undergraduate students starting in August, the liability will stand at 50% in case the withdrawal takes place before course commencement & remaining 50% will be liable after completion of 90 days from the course commencement date. \u27a2 The university reserves the right to take appropriate action against students who fail to pay their fees, or make satisfactory arrangements to pay on, or by the end of a set period after the starting date of their course. When to pay fees: Students either can make the full payment or can opt for the payment in instalments as per the fee payment schedule declared and published by the university. First Installment Fee will have to be paid in full for the seat to be confirmed in candidate \u2019s name (no parti al payments are permitted) . How to pay fees: 39 | P a g e The University is committed to offering a simplified payment experience, which is both secure and safe.

Awards Funding Amount: 25K to 3L Duration of Project: 6 months to 3 years (Progress evaluation after every 6 months) Selection Criteria The R&D Cell will issue a call for proposals once a year, and individual faculty or a group of faculties along with the student members can submit their applications. An innovation screening committee will be established to review the proposals according to a prede\ufb01ned process, and the committee will make recommendations or non-recommendations for individual projects. The endorsement of an innovation project will depend on the innovation funds resulting in a solution for current technical and social challenges that eventually leads to the generation of intellectual property that can be marketed and has potent ial for commercial success through technology transfer. Teams of students are also eligible to apply for innovation funds. The teams will be required to present their ideas before a panel of experts and industry sponsors, following a \u2018Shark Tank\u2019 model.

Alongside its undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, MIT -WPU also encourages its faculty members and academic staff to undertake consultancy projects with industry and other institutions. This not only expands and strengthens the research pro\ufb01le of MIT-WPU but also creates new knowledge and broadens the experience of faculty and staff members. This document provid es a formal framework to guide the implementation of this process. AIM OF THE DOCUMENT MIT-WPU aims to be a university that fosters innovation and is committed to adopting best practices in its engagement with external organizations. The university rec ognizes that consultancy work and external activity undertaken by its staff are crucial and valuable aspects of its operations. MIT-WPU believes that such activities are essential for knowledge exchange and can result in mutually bene\ufb01cial outcomes for both, the university and external organizations. To support its staff in the delivery of approved consultancy work, MIT -WPU has established a policy that outlines the procedures and guidelines to be followed. This policy is a part of the university's human resources management procedures and forms a part of the contract of employment for the academic staff. PURPOSE The objective of this policy is to establish the rules and regulations that govern consultancy and other external service s provided by the staff of MIT -WPU. MIT-WPU acknowledges the signi\ufb01cance of its staff engaging in consultancy for external organizations, particularly for the industry. MIT -WPU recognizes this as a vital medium through which knowledge and expertise can be shared with and from businesses and other external agencies, thereby promoting the development of mutually bene\ufb01cial relationships with these organizations. Thus, MIT -WPU promotes and supports its staff members to under take consultancy and similar work, as long as it does not contradict the interests of MIT -WPU. It is expected by MIT -WPU that external consultancy engagement will be undertaken with the highest levels of professionalism and integrity by staff members. MIT-WPU expects that the consultancy work will contribute to the development of mutually bene\ufb01cial relationships with external organizations, including industry bodies, and that it will further enhance the knowledge and expertise of staff members, thus supporting the overall development of MIT-WPU. The policy aims to provide guidance and support to staf f members in undertaking consultancy work in a way that is consistent with the interests of MIT-WPU and ensures transparency, ethical practice, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations. Benefits of engagement: External consultancy provides an opportunity for the staff members to increase their professional and/or academic competence and experience, and a chance for continuing professional education by working with industry. Engaging in external consultancy can help to create and su stain relationships between MIT -WPU and external organizations, leading to bene\ufb01ts such as increased research opportunities, student admission and placement, and ultimately contributing to knowledge exchange for the bene\ufb01t of the country. External consultancy can also generate additional income for the staff members and increased funding for MIT-WPU. MIT-WPU CONSULTANCY POLICY RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 24 www.mitwpu.edu.in APPLICABILITY MIT-WPU aims to promote and support consultancy work among its staff members in accordance with the University's employment policies and regulations. Academic staff are encouraged to engage in consultancy work that aligns with their respective disciplines and does not hinder their primary role within their department. This policy is applicable to all academic, academic -related, and administrative staff members of MIT-WPU and is to be adhered to in uniformity.

If issues are problematic, approval of the Pro-Vice Chancellor/Vice Chancellor shall be sought before \ufb01nal sign -off. If a client insists on an agreement on their terms, R&D will review the Client's terms and conditions, in consultation with the Legal Department of MIT-WPU, for acceptance or renegotiation. Any agreement outside of the approved standard terms and conditions can only be entered into after approval from MIT-WPU's management and shall be done by R&D. EARNINGS DISTRIBUTION MODEL The distribution model is based on income per consultancy agreement per \ufb01nancial year. Sr. No. Earnings PI & Team** MIT-WPU 1 Intellectual Consultancy 80% 20% 2 MIT-WPU Consultancy 70% 30% 3 Testing and Evaluation 60% 40% 4 Standardization and Calibration 60% 40% **The applicable income tax and other statutory taxes will be deducted from the staff's payment, and they will receive only the net amount after deductions. The payment cannot be given in cash or any other form for personal bene\ufb01t and will be paid only ele ctronically into the individual's salary bank account. The share mentioned is in addition to the individual's regular salary. Each Consultancy Agreement contract will have a unique price that will be determined on a case -by-case basis, taking into consideration the client and the nature of the project. The maximum consultancy income permissible for a staff member under the standard distribution model shall not exceed their total salary for the year, which includes basic pay and standard allowances like dearness allowance but does not include other payments such as ex-gratia, monetary or non-monetary awards. This limit applies in any \ufb01nancial year, and any amount exceeding this limit shall be deposited into MIT -WPU's Research Fund. The creation of teaching and academic materials as well as other publications such as books and articles in a consultancy project will be subject to MIT-WPU's Policy on Intellectual Property. 29 MIT-WPU C CLARIFICATIONS For all matters not covered in this document, as a general principle, Dean R&D / Director R&D may be approached for clari\ufb01cations required, if any. GENERAL All payments made for consultancy services must be processed through MIT -WPU's designated bank a ccount. This means that payments should be made in the name of MIT -WPU and not directly to individual faculty members. MIT-WPU will ensure compliance with statutory laws and distribute the appropriate share to the faculty/staff involved in the consultancy project. The client shall not be provided with a detailed breakdown of the consultancy charges, and only a lump sum \ufb01gure of the total consultancy charges may be quoted. Nevertheless, the working sheet must be kept as part of the internal records and may be subject to an internal audit as deemed necessary. The consultancy agreement must comply with the laws of India as per t he Standardized Terms and Conditions. However, in exceptional circumstances and with proper approvals, compliance with both local and international laws may be considered. The Principal Investigator (PI) is solely responsible for completing the project and delivering the agreed -upon deliverables. MIT-WPU only provides necessary support to the PI. After the completion of the project, the Principal Investigator (PI) shall provide a Final Project Completion Report (PCR) to the funding agency. Additionally, two copies of the report shall be submitted to the R&D Cell for record keeping. To ensure the project account can be closed by the Finance Department of MIT-WPU, it is important to obtain a Completion Certi\ufb01cate (CC) from the funding agency to con\ufb01rm the successful completion of the project. Testing and evaluation services can be provided to ful\ufb01ll the requirements of governmental and associated organizations, speci\ufb01c clients, and external educational institutions. MIT-WPU may provide Standardization and Calibration services in areas where the necessary facilities are available or can be expanded. It is recommended that these services be supported by regular calibration and standardization of the laboratory equipment used for these purposes. For signi\ufb01cant projects where the consultancy value exceeds Rs. 5 Lakhs (Rupees Five Lakhs only), payments may be accepted against agreed -upon milestones with appropriate prior approvals. However, for smaller projects or daily consultancy work, payments must be obtained in advance from the client(s). In exceptional situations where the assigned PI is unable to complete the consultancy work undertaken by MIT-WPU, MIT-WPU retains the authority to reassign the consultancy to another investigator. If completing the consultancy is deemed impossible or unfeasible by MIT-WPU, the Approver will address the matter with the client to close the project.

The project account will be handled by the faculty or principal investigator (PI), who will spend the funds as required. The institute's share should also be transferred. The requirement for a consultancy project/task/work can originate from the industry or other organizations concerned, or the faculty can approach the industry or other organizations. The faculty is expected to estimate the time and cost required to accompl ish the task. A proposal is then prepared by the principal investigator (PI). The budget for the proposal should be in one part and re\ufb02ect the project consultancy fee for the principal investigator (PI), co -PI, and other investigators, 50% overheads to MIT -WPU, and service tax on the total amount if applicable. Service tax is subject to periodic revision by the Government of India. Service tax is not applicable on projects if the funds are received in foreign currency. Expenses for equipment, supporting manpower, travel, and contingency must also be included in the budget, if necessary.

TESTING PROJECTS Testing refers to the process of assessing a component or product against established standards. This may include testing the strength of concrete in construction, soil compaction strength, pressure gauge calibration, and chemical identi\ufb01cation, drug ident i\ufb01cation, estimation, and evaluation of unknown species. MIT-WPU will undertake testing jobs if facilities are available, and if such testing does not interfere with any teaching or research work. Faculty may initiate testing jobs once a request is receive d. The overall procedure for operation of the testing project is similar to that of a consultancy project. GENERAL GUIDELINES Limitations: Involving Foreign Collaborators: Publications of Results: Performing regular testing tasks should be discouraged. Additionally, it is important to exercise caution and ensure that consultancy projects do not hinder the regular duties of faculty members. The proposals that involve foreign collaborators must comply with the National Laws, Rules, Regulations, and procedures in effect regarding funding support to each partner. Researchers who wish to publish technical or scienti\ufb01c papers based on the project 's research work should follow the sponsoring agency's guidelines and acknowledge the agency's assistance in the publications. If the research results are to be legally protected, the investigators should take necessary steps to secure legal protection for the research results before publishing them. External Consultants External consultants may be engaged to provide comprehensive services to clients, but their in Consul tancy Projects: Con\ufb02ict of Interest: Consultants: Exceptions: utilization will be limited. They will be entitled to receive a lump sum honorarium or fee, which should not exceed 30% of the total consultancy fee speci\ufb01ed in the Consultancy Projects Proposal. Consultants are required to disclose in writing to the Dean R&D any relationship they may have with the client funding the consultancy project or any vendor to whom payments are made from project funds, such as the involvement of immediate relatives, or any potential scope for dispro - portionate self -gain. A commi ttee will review such cases and advise the Dean R&D to ensure that there is no actual con\ufb02ict of interest, and that the consultant's involvement does not compromise their objectivity, integrity, or commitment to the Institute and the profession. Consultants are prohibited from using the name of the Institute or their af\ufb01liation with the Institute in a way that (i) implies that the Institute endorses or opposes a product or service provided by a pro\ufb01t, non- pro\ufb01t, or government entity, (ii) suggests that the Institute has conducted research or released research \ufb01ndings when it has not done so, or presents the results of Institute research in a misleading manner, or (iii) could be perceived as conveying the of\ufb01cial position of the Institute on any matter of public interest. Book royalty and honorarium for services like Expert Committee meetings, invited lectures, Ph.D. viva/evaluation, invited training programmes, organization of conferences/workshops are not considered part of the consultancy services. 43 C MIT-WPU RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 44 www.mitwpu.edu.in PREAMBLE MIT World Peace University, hereafter referred to as MIT-WPU/Institute, has been striving for the last 40 years to develop a pool of high -quality scienti\ufb01c and technical professionals and provide solutions to various challenging technological issues that may arise in different \ufb01elds. The Institute is supported by well - quali\ufb01ed faculty and highly skilled staff, committed to be coming a premier center of teaching, research, and extension in Engineering and Technology. The Institute fosters academic excellence, innovation, and encourages scholarship and research. The MIT World Peace University recognizes the value of intangible assets such as inventions, copyrights, know -how, designs, and other creative and innovative products resulting from the intellectual and scienti\ufb01c endeavors of its faculty and students, whic h provide a competitive advantage to the Institute. To provide guidance on the practices and rules regarding intellectual property rights (IPR), ownership, commercial exploitation, technology transfer, and con\ufb01dentiality requirements, the Institute has for mulated its intellectual property policy. The policy aims to create an environment conducive to curiosity -driven and market -driven research and development activities, as well as the creation of original works of authorship, for the bene\ufb01t of the Institute, its faculty, staff, students, research scholars, and external agencies. It should be emphasized that this IPR policy should be considered as a guide rather than a rigid regulation in the legal sense, given the constantly evolving landscape of the national IPR policy, and may be subject to modi\ufb01cations if necessary. This document, along with the accompanying addendum (Operating guidelines) and annexures (providing useful information on Patents and Copyright), is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the Intellectual Property (IP) management framework at MIT -WPU. PURPOSE The purpose of the IPR policy of MIT-WPU is to: The primary objective of MIT -WPU's intellectual property policy is to facilitate, encourage, promote and",

To provide guidance on the practices and rules regarding intellectual property rights (IPR), ownership, commercial exploitation, technology transfer, and con\ufb01dentiality requirements, the Institute has for mulated its intellectual property policy. The policy aims to create an environment conducive to curiosity -driven and market -driven research and development activities, as well as the creation of original works of authorship, for the bene\ufb01t of the Institute, its faculty, staff, students, research scholars, and external agencies. It should be emphasized that this IPR policy should be considered as a guide rather than a rigid regulation in the legal sense, given the constantly evolving landscape of the national IPR policy, and may be subject to modi\ufb01cations if necessary. This document, along with the accompanying addendum (Operating guidelines) and annexures (providing useful information on Patents and Copyright), is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the Intellectual Property (IP) management framework at MIT -WPU. PURPOSE The purpose of the IPR policy of MIT-WPU is to: The primary objective of MIT -WPU's intellectual property policy is to facilitate, encourage, promote and safeguard scienti\ufb01c inquiry, research pursuits and academic freedom of its faculty, researchers and students. The Institute aims to foster a culture of innovation that encourages the creation and development of intellectual property within its premises.; The policy aims to provide a clear understanding of the rights and responsibilities of the faculty, staff, and students regarding intellectual property and to protect the interests of the Institute and its members. One of the objectives of the MIT-WPU IPR policy is to establish a comprehensive management policy and procedural guidelines for converting the knowledge generated within the Institute to wealth. This involves the identi\ufb01cation, protection, management, and commercialization of intellectual property assets, such as patents, copyrights, and trademar ks, with the aim of generating income for the Institute and its members. The policy also includes guidelines for technology transfer, licensing agreements, and spin -off companies, as well as procedures for resolving disputes related to IPR. The primary objective of the IPR policy is to enable the Institute to make effective and bene\ufb01cial use of the intellectual property created by its members, in order to maximize the bene\ufb01ts to the inventors, the Institute, and the society as a whole. The aim is to establish the Institute as a leading academic research center that upholds the highest standards of scholarship and teaching. This can be achieved by disseminating the bene\ufb01ts of intellectual property generated at the Institute to the communi ty and society. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (POLICY AND GUIDELINES) OBJECTIVES The IPR policy of the Institute aims to: The Institute aims to protect and enhance the value of intellectual property created by its faculty, staff, and students during their tenure at the Institute. This will provide opportunities for wealth generation, alleviation of human suffering, and improvement of human life. The objective is to promote awareness and culture of IPR among the faculty, staff, and students of the Institute by implementing prudent IP management practices. Establish a centralized and comprehensive reference system to address all IPR related issues in a streamlined and ef\ufb01cient manner, making it easier for faculty, staff, and students to access infor mation and receive guidance. The IPR policy of the Institute aims to proactively create an environment that fosters the generation of new knowledge through research and innovations, while also aligning with the educational mission of the Institute. SCOPE This policy applies to all forms of intellectual property resulting from the intellectual and scienti\ufb01c pursuits of the following individuals: faculty members, staff, students, research scholars (both internal and external), individuals employed in sponsored research and consultancy projects, visiting scientists/professors/professionals who contribute to the teaching and research wor k conducted at the Institute, whether full -time or part -time, regardless of whether these rights are eligible for registration. The intellectual property generated from academic research encompasses patents, designs, copyright, know -how, and con\ufb01dential in formation. POLICY STATEMENT The Institute is dedicated to balancing the promotion, protection, management, and commercialization of intellectual property while also maintaining its core values of teaching, research, and community service. It acknowledg es the importance of commercializing and exploiting intellectual property for generating additional revenue for the Institute and offering bene\ufb01ts to its staff and students. However, the Institute also acknowledges the signi\ufb01cance of traditional academic v alues and expectations. DEFINITIONS Intellectual Property (IP) refers to intangible knowledge products and encompasses all types of results, conclusions, deductions, inventions, ideas, improvements, discoveries, enhancements, solutions, processes, modi\ufb01cations, know -how, data, and informatio n that are conceived, generated, made, or reduced to practice by the faculty, staff, students, research scholars, and other employees of the Institute. This includes designs, software programmes, genetically engineered microorganisms, business models, and copyrightable works that result from their intellectual output. IP is the result of research supported or sponsored by the Institute, industrial consulting, or other collaborative research and development efforts. Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) refers to the legal rights that are granted to individuals or entities for their creative and innovative works. These rights are derived from various forms of intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. IPR grants exclusive rights to the creators or owners of intellectual property, allowing them to contr ol the use, distribution, and commercialization of their creations. This ensures that they are able to bene\ufb01t \ufb01nancially from their work and encourages further innovation and creativity. Some examples of IPR include the following: Patents: These are legal protections granted to inventors for their new and useful inventions or discoveries. They give the inventor the exclusive right to manufacture, use, and sell the invention for a certain period. 45 C MIT-WPU RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 46 www.mitwpu.edu.in Trademarks: Copyrights: Trade Secrets: These are symbols, logos, or phrases used to identify and distinguish a particular product or service from others.

Trademarks protect the brand iden tity of a company or individual and prevent others from using similar marks that could confuse consumers. These are legal protections granted to authors, artists, and creators for their original works of expression, such as books, music, \ufb01lms, and software. Copyrights give the creator the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, and display their work. These are con\ufb01dential business information or practices that give a company a competitive advantage. Trade secret protection prevents others from using or disclosing secret information without permission. Overall, IPR plays a crucial role in protecting and incentivizing innovation and creativity by providing legal protections an d \ufb01nancial rewards for the creators and owners of intellectual property. Background information the term \"background information\" in a Collaborative Research and Development programme refers to the technical knowledge and expertise that is owned or controlled by the programme partners before the commencement of the programme. This information is typically in the same \ufb01eld as the programme's subject matter or in related \ufb01elds that are necessary for the successful execution of the programme. The term \"Institute Personnel\" as used in this policy document encompasses a wide range of individuals including but not limited to full-time and part -time faculty members, staff, students, research scholars (both internal and external), visiting scientists, professors, and other professionals who are employed or engaged by the institute. OWNERSHIP OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Whenever the Institute \ufb01les an application for ownership of intellectual property rights, it is require d to acknowledge and mention all individuals who have made signi\ufb01cant intellectual contributions to the creation or invention in question. These individuals must be identi\ufb01ed as inventors or creators in the application. Copyrights The ownership of copyright on all teaching and instructional materials created by employees of the Institute as part of any academic programmes or activities shall belong to the Institute. However, the author(s) of such materials shall retain the right to use the materials in their professional work. This clause does not apply to books, articles, monographs, speeches, and other works produced by the Institute staff members during research and teaching, using Institute resources. The Institute acknowledges and recognizes that the faculty members own the copyright to such traditional works of authorship. In situations where Institute employees have created copyrightable works, including software, using. signi\ufb01cant Institute resources, the Institute may require the employees to assign some or all of the copyright to such works. The extent to which the Institute's resources have been used to produce the copyrightable work will determine the extent of the assignment of the copyright. The Institute shall have ownership of the copyright of works created by non-Institute personnel who are engaged or associated with any Institute activity, regardless of whether Institute personnel have made intellectual contributions to such works or not. In cases where copyrightable works are created during sponsored or collaborative activities, the ownership of copyright shall be determined either in accordance with the terms and conditions related to intellectual property speci\ufb01ed in the contract governing such activity (if any), or through mutual consultations and agreement between the Institute and the sponsoring/collaborating agency. 47 www.mitwpu.edu.in In the case of a thesis, dissertation, or project report written by a student, the ownership of copyright shall be jointly held by the student and their guide. However, the Institute may demand the full assignment of the copyright in such cases. In cases where the Institute does not demand the assignment of copyright or where the copyright has not been assigned to the Institute, the Institute shall be entitled to a non -exclusive, non -transferable lic ense to use the work within the Institute for non-commercial educational and research purposes. Additionally, the Institute may possess a limited number of copies of the work for such purposes. Unless otherwise speci\ufb01ed in the original contract for the work, any copyrightable work that is generated as a work -for-hire shall normally belong to the Institute. If the Institute anticipates a potential \ufb01nancial gain from any copyrights, it may take steps to \ufb01le and protect such copyrights and share the result ing \ufb01nancial bene\ufb01ts with the creator(s) according to the terms and conditions established by the Institute. Institute - Supported Research All intellectual property rights arising from investigations conducted at the Institute using the Institute's resources shall belong to and be the exclusive property of the Institute, except in cases where such investigations are conduct - ed jointly with o ther institutions and agencies or are sponsored by an outside agency. Sponsored Research The intellectual property rights (IPR) of inventions resulting from research projects that are carried out on behalf of and fully funded by a sponsoring agency shall be registered jointly in the name of the Institute and the sponsoring agency if the cost of securing and maintaining the IPR registration is shared equally between the Institute and the sponsoring agency.

Institute - Supported Research All intellectual property rights arising from investigations conducted at the Institute using the Institute's resources shall belong to and be the exclusive property of the Institute, except in cases where such investigations are conduct - ed jointly with o ther institutions and agencies or are sponsored by an outside agency. Sponsored Research The intellectual property rights (IPR) of inventions resulting from research projects that are carried out on behalf of and fully funded by a sponsoring agency shall be registered jointly in the name of the Institute and the sponsoring agency if the cost of securing and maintaining the IPR registration is shared equally between the Institute and the sponsoring agency. However, if the sponsoring agency is not willing to share the costs of registration and maintenance, the IPR shall belong exclusively to the Institute. If the sponsoring agency is not willing to share the cost of securing and maintaining the IPR registration for jointly \ufb01led applications, the Institute may, at its discretion, \ufb01le the application with sole ownership and bear the entire cost of securing and protecting the IPR. In cases where the research project is only partially funded by the sponsoring agency or if there are multiple sponsors for the same project, the sharing of IPR shall be determined through mutual consultations and appropriate agreements between the Institute and the sponsoring agency(ies). If the sponsoring agency is an industry, they may choose one of the following options for sharing the IPR with the Institute: The Institute may enter into an agreement with the sponsoring industry where the ownership of IPR will rest with the industry. However, the industry will have to pay the Institute an initial lump sum and reasonable annual royalties for a speci\ufb01c period as recognition of the Institute's contribution to the project. The terms of ownership of the IPR will be governed by a speci\ufb01c prior agreement between the Institute and the sponsoring industry. The ownership of IPR rested in the sponsoring industry may be exclusive or non -exclusive. In case of exclusive ownership, if the industrial sponsor fails to exploit within a mutually agreed time limit, the Institute may permit third -party exploitation of the IPR. The Institute shall retain ownership of the IPR, but the industrial sponsor shall have the right to exploit the IPR either exclusively or non-exclusively. This right will be granted in exchang e for an initial lump sum payment, subsequent annual royalties for a speci\ufb01ed period, or other bene\ufb01ts to the Institute as mutually agreed upon. In cases of exclusive exploitation rights, if the industrial sponsor fails to exploit the IPR within an agreed -upon time limit, third -party exploitation may be permitted. The Institute shall retain user rights for the purposes of further research and development. The terms of ownership and exploitation rights will be governed by a speci\ufb01c prior agreement between the Institute and the sponsoring industry. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 Joint Research In the case of intellectual property resulting from joint research conducted by Institute personnel with external organizations/agencies/individuals, the ownership of the IP will be jointly shared by the Institute and the collaborators. The cost of \ufb01ling a nd maintaining the IPR as well as the revenue generated from its commercial exploitation will be shared by both parties according to an agreed -upon formula. If the collaborators do not agree to share the cost, the Institute may decide at its discretion to \ufb01le and maintain the IPR at its own expense. In such cases, the sharing of revenue resulting from the commercial exploitation of the IPR will be determined solely by the Institute. Technology Transfer The Institute will make all efforts to commercially exploit the IPR obtained, either solely or jointly with other agencies, to the fullest extent reasonably possible and without unnecessary delay. The marketing of the IPR will be conducted through technology transfer agreements, licensing (both exclusive and non-exclusive), and revenue -sharing models. The Institute will attempt to \ufb01nd potential licensees to commercially exploit the intellectual property (IP) that it owns outright. If the IP is jointly owned, the Institute will offer the \ufb01rst opportunity to commercially exploit it to the joint owners, regardless of whether the IP is protected by patents or not. This licensing agreement would require a lump sum payment as a technology transfer fee, as well as ongoing royalty payments for an agreed -upon period from the start of commercial exploitation. If the joint owner declines this option, the Institute will move forward with commercializing the IP in a manner it sees \ufb01t. If the other collaborating organization or industry does not undertake commercial exploitation within two years from the initial development of the technology, the Institute retains the right to license the use of the intellectual property to a third party. The Institute may support entrepreneurial activities among its staff by transferring ownership of an intellectual property to the inventor(s) or creator(s) of the property, through an agreement. This will enable the staff member s to market, protect, and license the intellectual property independently, with minimal involvement from the Institute. The Institute requires the assignee to pay all expenses related to patenting and licensing, as well as any royalties, equity, or other value received by the inventor(s) or creator(s). The Institute would make efforts to commercialize intellectual property, either through its own means or by hiring a Technology Management Agency to develop the IP created by its staff. After a speci\ufb01ed period, the inventor(s) or creator(s) may request that the Institute transfer the rights",

After a speci\ufb01ed period, the inventor(s) or creator(s) may request that the Institute transfer the rights to them. Revenue Sharing The sole applicant for any intellectual property (IP) generated at MIT-WPU will be the institute itself, and no sharing of revenue will occur, even if the IP is commercialized. However, in cases where the institute chooses to transfer the IP rights to the inventor(s)/creator(s), the inventor(s)/creator(s) will be required to reimburse the institute for all costs incurred in protecting, maintaining, marketing, and otherwise associated with the IP. 48 C MIT-WPU 49 www.mitwpu.edu.in Infringements, Damages, Liability, and Indemnity Insurance As a policy, the Institute will require any licensee to provide indemni\ufb01cation against any legal proceedings, including but not limited to those arising from manufacturing defects, production problems, design guarantees, and obligations related to upgrades and debugging, in any contract between the licensee and the Institute. The Institute will include an indemnity clause in agreements with licensees when transferring technology or copyrighted material, to protect its personne l. The Institute will also retain the right to decide whether or not to engage in any litigation concerning patents and license infringements. Conflict of Interest Inventors must disclose any con\ufb02icts of interest or potential con\ufb02icts of interest. If the inventor(s) or their immediate family have a stake in a licensee or potential licensee company, they must disclose the stake they or their immediate family have in the company. In the case of a license or an assignment of rights for a patent to a company where the inventor(s) have a stake, the approval of the IPR Cell will be required. Dispute Resolution If there are any disputes between the Institute and the inventors concerning the implementation of the IP policy, the aggrieved party can appeal to the Vice Chancellor of the Institute. The Institute will make efforts to address the concerns of the aggrieved party. However, the decision of the Chancellor will be \ufb01nal and binding in this matter. APPLICATION OF POLICY This policy is considered a part of the conditions of employment for every employee of the Institute, as well as a condition of enrollment and attendance for students at the Institute. The policy applies to all existing staff and students upon enrollment. Bottom of Form The Institute retains the right to amend the IPR Policy as necessary or deemed appropriate. All potential cre ators who use Institute -sponsored resources or participate in a sponsored research project must comply with this policy and accept the principles of intellectual property ownership outlined in this policy, unless an exception is approved in writing by the Institute. RIGHT TO REGULATE POLICY The IPR Cell is responsible for interpreting the policy, resolving disputes, and applying the policy. The cell may also recommend changes to the policy p eriodically to the Registrar and Vice Chancellor, who will make decisions on any suggested changes. The IPR policy may be reviewed every three years, or earlier if there is a signi\ufb01cant change in the national policy. LEGAL JURISDICTION As a policy, all ag reements signed by the Institute and any resulting disputes will be subject to the legal jurisdiction of the Court of Adjudication in Pune only. These agreements will be governed by the appropriate laws of India.

IP PROTECTION -SOME EXPLANATORY NOTES (To be read in conjunction with MIT-WPU IPR\u2013Annexure: some useful information on patents and copyright) Intellectual property can take various forms such as patents, industrial designs, trademarks, copyrights, con\ufb01dential information, technical know -how, mask works, processes, plans, speci\ufb01cations, guidelines, graphics, training materials, softwa re programmes, records, drawings, instruction guides, student materials, new techniques, algorithms, concepts, and more. To be protected by MIT World Peace University, the intangible product of the intellect must have potential for industrial application o r for enhancing the S&T knowledge base. A patent can be awarded for any invention that is capable of being commercially applied. To meet the patentability standards, the invention must satisfy the criteria of novelty, utility, and non -obviousness. Addition ally, there must be an inventive step, which refers to an innovation that is not apparent to a person with ordinary skill in the relevant \ufb01eld. The invention may pertain to a new product, an improvement to an existing product, or a new process of manufacturing an existing or new product. Design protection can be obtained for any prototype that in\ufb02uences the consumer's choice by appealing to their aesthetic sense. In simpler terms, design protection can be secured for the appearance, visual features, and overall look of the article. However, design protection is not available for functional features. Patents are intended to safeguard applied and extension research, while copyright law is designed to protect pure or fundamental research.

PROCEDURE FOR IP PROTECTION All patent and copyright applications (as per profo rma MIT -WPU/IPR -01 and MIT -WPU/IPR -02, respectively) must be sent to the Convener/Dean R&D through the IPR Cell via the Dean of the School or Director of the Center, regardless of whether the inventions have resulted from in - house projects or sponsored projects. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 52 MIT-WPU C RECORD KEEPING PROCEDURES All data and details produced by a creator during the creation of intellectual property should be meticulously documented in the relevant School/Centre, with speci\ufb01c emphasis on the following: Avoid using abbreviations or technical terms that are not commonly understood, unless they are explained in a table at the beginning or end of the book. This will ensure that readers who are not familiar with the terminology can understand the text without confusion or dif\ufb01culty. Important information such as data, descriptions, or experiments that pertain to signi\ufb01cant inventions or discoveries should be attributed and documented by the individual(s) responsible for the project, such as the creator, supervisor, or coordinator. I. Any changes that need to be made should be indicated by crossing out the deleted content and labeling it as \"cancelled\". The corrected data, clearly marked as such, should be entered immediately below and authenticated by the creator with their initials an d the date. II. In cases where new products are created or produced by a new method, it is advisable to preserve samples and take photographs for record keeping purposes. All photographs should be dated and signed by the creator on the back. When Should Faculty Approach IPR Cell To Discuss a Possible Patent? MIT-WPU has established an exclusive IPR Cell to manage intellectual property rights. Faculty members who have created potential intellectual property while employed by MIT-WPU can approach the IPR Cell advisor to arrange a discussion at a mutually convenient time. It is recommended that this discussion occurs well in advance of the idea maturing into a process or product. If the invention is only in the conception stage, it is possible to \ufb01le a provisional speci\ufb01cation, which must be followed up with a complete speci\ufb01cation within 12 months; otherwise, the patent application will be considered abandoned. However, if the inventor has an innovative product that can be immediately marketed, a complete speci\ufb01cation can be lod ged right away. EVALUATION OF PATENT/COPYRIGHT APPLICATIONS The IPR Cell will receive and examine each patent/copyright application submitted through an Invention Disclosure Form/Copyright Disclosure form according to the MIT-WPU/IPR -01/MIT -WPU/IPR -02 proforma. Additionally, an IPR facilitation request (MIT -WPU/IPR -03) must be included. The committee may request assistance from other professors who are experts in the relevant \ufb01eld to conduct an initial evaluation of proposals for their potential patentability. These domain experts will be required to sign a non-Disclosure agreement according to the MIT -WPU/IPR -04 proforma and a No Con\ufb02ict -of-Interest Form according to the MIT -WPU/IPR -05 profor ma before being granted access to the proposal. If necessary, the inventors may be asked to present their case before the IPR Cell. If the Cell recommends \ufb01ling for patents, the Convener of the IPR Cell will facilitate the application through one of the a pproved attorneys from the panel maintained by the IPR Cell. ASSISTANCE IN FILLING THE PROFORMA Once the IPR Cell approves protecting the Intellectual output, a patent Attorney shall be identi\ufb01ed by the Cell for drafting the IP application. The following aspects need to receive attention: Objective of the invention: What problem is the inventor trying to solve? What are the issues involved? The objective of the invention should clearly state the problem that the inventor is trying to solve. This should be a concise statement that identi\ufb01es the issues involved in the invention. For example, the objective of the invention might be to develop a more ef\ufb01cient method for processing data or to create a new device that solves a speci\ufb01c problem in a particular industry. 53 www.mitwpu.edu.in What prior art searches have been made?

Who are responsible for administration of IPRs in the country? The Controller General of Patents, Designs, and Trademarks is responsible for overseeing patents, designs, and trademarks. This department operates under the Ministry of Industry's Department of Industrial Development. Copyright, on the other hand, falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Human Resource Development. 4. What is a patent? A patent is a legal monopoly which is granted for a limited time to the owner of an invention. Patent rights A patent is a legal right granted by the state that provides a limited -time monopoly to the owner of an invention. Simply possessing a patent does not automatically give the owner the right to use or exploit the patented invention; other laws and regulations, such as those governing health and safety, food and drugs, and inheritance, may also affect these rights. Patent rights can be sold, licensed, inherited, abandoned, and may even be subject to revocation by the state in certain circumstances, both before and aft er the grant of the patent. Additionally, there are global patents available for international protection. 55 www.mitwpu.edu.in 5. What is the distinction between patented invention and know -how? According to the law, a patent speci\ufb01cation does not have to disclose all the information required for the commercial exploitation of the invention. Therefore, the information provided in a patent speci\ufb01cation may not be suf\ufb01cient for commercialization purposes. In contrast, known -how refers to all the information necessary for commercializing an invention, such as details of production methods and design drawings needed to set up a production plant. If known -how is developed around an existing patent and subsequently commercialized without the patentee's agreement, it may be considered an infringement of the patent unless the patentee has agreed to such commercialization on mutually. Agreed terms. 6. How is an invention interpreted? For an invention to be considered patentable, it must not only be novel, but also involve an inventive step. This means that the invention must not be obvious to a person skilled in the relevant \ufb01eld, taking into consideration the state of the art, but disregarding unpublished pending patent applications. However, simplicity is not necessarily a barrier to securing a patent. The means of achieving the desired outcome may be simple and common, but an inventive step may still exist if the inventor has developed a variant that produces more useful results. It does not matter whether the invention was developed by accident, as long as it involves some level of inventive step. Whether or not it has been in the meantime sold or licensed. There is no such thing as What are patentable inventions under the patent Act, 1970? Invention means any new and useful: Art, process, method, or manner of manufacture Machines, apparatus, or another article Substances produced by manufacture and included any new and useful improvements of any of them and an alleged invention. However, inventions claiming substances intended for use; or capable of being used, as food or as medicine of drug or relating to subst ances prepared or produced by chemical processes (including alloys, optical glass, semi -conductors, and inter -metallic compounds) are not patentable. 7. How is the novelty of and invention determined? The novelty of an invention is determined based on the knowledge that is available globally, including in India, at the time of \ufb01ling the patent application. This means that the invention should not have been known or disclosed to the public anywhere in the world before the \ufb01ling date of the patent application . 8. What are the types of inventions which are not patentable? An invention which is frivolous, or which claims anything obviously contrary to well established natural laws e.g., different types of perpetual motion or machines which violate the third law of thermodynamics. An invention that has a primary or intended use which is contrary to law or morality or injurious to public health is not considered patentable. For example, a process for preparing a beverage that involves the use of a carcinogenic substance, even if the beverage has a higher nourishment value, would not be considered patentable. The mere discovery of a scienti\ufb01c principle or the form ulation of an abstract theory is not patentable. For example, the discovery of the Raman Effect, which is a scienti\ufb01c principle, cannot be patented. However, an invention that makes use of scienti\ufb01c principle or theory can be patented if it meets the criteria of novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability. To be patentable, the invention must involve an inventive step. Thus, the mere discovery of any new property or",

Thus, the mere discovery of any new property or new use of a known substance or the mere use of a known process, machine or apparatus is not considered patentable, unless such a known process results in a new product or employs at least one new reactant. In other words, there must be some degree of i nnovation and improvement in the known substance or process to be eligible for a patent. A substance that is created by simply mixing existing substances together, resulting only in the combination of their properties, is not patentable. The same applies to a process for creating such a substance. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 56 MIT-WPU C The mere arrangement, rearrangement, or duplication of features of known devices, each functioning independently of one another in a known way, is not considered an invention and hence not patentable. In other words, a patent cannot be granted for a combin ation of known features that does not result in any new or improved function or technical effect. A method or process of testing applicable during the process of manufacture for rendering the machine, apparatus, or other equipment more ef\ufb01cient. A method of agriculture or horticulture. Any process for medicinal, surgical, curative, prophylactic or other treatment of human \u2018beings, or any process for a simila r treatment of animals or plants. Invention relating to atomic energy. 9. When should an application for a patent be \ufb01led? a) It is important to \ufb01le a patent application as soon as possible, rather than waiting until the invention is fully developed for commercial use. Filing an application with a provisional speci\ufb01cation can help establish priority for the applicant. Delay in \ufb01ling an application can lead to risks such as other inventors applying for a patent for the same invention before the \ufb01rst inventor, or inadvertent publica tion of the invention by the inventor or others independently. What are the essential patent documents to be generated and submitted by a potential patentee? b) There are two types of patent documents usually known as patent speci\ufb01cation namely. Provisional speci\ufb01cation Complete speci\ufb01cation PROVISIONAL SPECIFICATION To add to the previous answer, a complete speci\ufb01cation is a detailed description of the invention and how to make and use it. It should include claims that de\ufb01ne the scope of the invention for which protection is sought. The claims must be clear, concise, and supported by the description. The complete speci\ufb01cation must be \ufb01led within 12 months from the date of \ufb01ling the provisional speci\ufb01cation, and failure to do so will result in the abandonment of the application. It's also worth noting that while a provisional speci\ufb01cation may be \ufb01led without any claims, the complete speci\ufb01cation must include at least one claim de\ufb01ning the scope of the invention. The claims must be carefully drafted to ensure that they are not overly broad or vague, which could result in the patent being challenged or invalidated later. The provisional speci\ufb01cation is not a permanent and independent scienti\ufb01c cum legal document. It is a temporary document \ufb01led to establish priority of the invention and to secure a \ufb01ling date. Amendments to the provisional speci\ufb01cation can be made at any time before \ufb01ling a complete speci\ufb01cation. However, once a complete speci\ufb01cation is \ufb01led, amendments to the provisional speci\ufb01cation are not allowed. COMPLETE SPECIFICATION To obtain a patent, it is necessary to submit a Complete Speci\ufb01cation. This speci\ufb01cation should include informa - tion about the \ufb01eld to which the invention relates, the background of the prior art, any drawbacks related to the previously known details of the invention, the best way of carrying out the invention, and claims that de\ufb01ne the scope of the invention. The Complete Speci\ufb01cation should provide enough information to enable a person skilled in the art to work on the invention without requiring assistance from the inventor. 57 www.mitwpu.edu.in 10. What are the criteria for naming inventors(s) in an application for patent? The naming of inventors is normally decided based on the following criteria: All persons who have contributed towards the conception or reduction to practice of at least one claim of the invention should be named as an inventor. Intellectual contribution towards the results of the research work leading to a patent is not suf\ufb01cient for being named as an inventor. Contribution towards the conception or reduction to practice of at least one claim of the invention is necessary. A person who has not contributed to the conception or reduction to practice of at least one claim of the invention is not entitled to be included as an inventor. A person who provides only routine assistance, such as making dr awings or constructing a prototype under the direction of an inventor, is not entitled to be named as an inventor. Dif\ufb01culties may arise in determining who should be named as an inventor, and to avoid such situations,",

Dif\ufb01culties may arise in determining who should be named as an inventor, and to avoid such situations, it is important for all researchers to maintain clear and accurate records of their work in a consecutively numbered diary, with entries signed by both the researchers and their team leader. 11. Can a published or disclosed invention be patented? To clarify, if an inventor publicly discloses their invention before \ufb01ling a patent application, it could potentially prevent them from obtaining a patent. This is because one of the requirements for obtaining a patent is that the invention must be new and non -obvious at the time the patent application is \ufb01led. If the invention has already been publi cly disclosed, it may no longer meet the novelty requirement. Therefore, it is generally recommended that inventors do not disclose their inventions publicly before \ufb01ling a patent application. Instead, they should keep their invention con\ufb01dential and \ufb01le a patent application as soon as possible. If an inventor does choose to disclose their invention before \ufb01ling a patent application, they may still be able to obtain a patent if they \ufb01le the application within a certain time frame. In the United States, for example, inventors have one year from the date of the \ufb01rst public disclosure to \ufb01le a patent application. If an inventor does obtain a patent, they should include the patent number and date in any subsequent publications or disclosures related to the invention. This provides information to the public about the existence of the patent and its scope of protection. 12. What is considered the date of patent? The date on which the complete speci\ufb01cation is \ufb01led is considered the date of patent, and it is a crucial date for determining the legal protection of the invention covered by the patent. The term of the patent is calculated from this date, and it is from this date that the exclusive rights of the patent holder begin. 13. What is the term of a patent in Indian system? The term of every patent in India is 20 years, starting from the date of \ufb01ling of the patent application, regardless of whether it was \ufb01led with a provisional or complete speci\ufb01cation. However, for applications \ufb01led under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), the term of 20 years begins from the international \ufb01ling date. 14. How does one keep a patent in force for the full patent terms? To maintain a patent's validity, the patent holder is required to pay renewal fees at regular intervals. If the renewal fees are not paid, the patent will expire and will no longer be legally enforceable. Once a patent has expired, the invention becomes open to the public, and anyone can use, manufacture or sell the invention without permission from the original patent holder. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 58 MIT-WPU C 15. What is expected from a patentee? As per Indian patent law, it is expected that a patent holder should work their invention in India on a commercial scale and without any unnecessary delay. A patent is not granted simply to provide a monopoly to the patent holder for importing the patented product into India. This means that a patent holder ca nnot simply hold onto their invention and prevent others from using it. The intention behind granting a patent is to promote innovation and encourage the progress of technology, and to ensure that the invention is being utilized for the bene\ufb01t of society. 16. What is the nature of the information needed while consulting a patent attorney? When working with a patent agent or attorney to \ufb01le a patent application, it is important to provide them with a clear and comprehensive explanation of the invention. This may include information about the history of the invention, including where the idea came from and how it was developed. Any early failures or prototypes may also be relevant to understanding the inventive step involved in the invention. It is important to highlight what you believe to be the most central and inventive aspect of the invention, as well as any similar prior inventions that may exist. If you have developed an improved version of a competitor's product, it is important to disclose this information to the patent agent. Honesty and transparency in these matters will help the patent agent to draft claims and speci \ufb01cations that accurately re\ufb02ect the invention and avoid any potential for excessive claims that could be rejected. By providing your patent agent with a comprehensive understanding of your invention, including its history, inventive elements, and any prio r inventions or improvements, they will be better equipped to draft a strong patent application that maximizes the protection of your invention. In order to \ufb01le a strong patent application, it is important to provide a detailed description of how the inve ntion can be practically used, as well as any test results or trials conducted",

This includes any failures or defects encountered during testing, as well as any alternative ways of using the invention or potential substitutes for its parts. It may be worthwhile to draft the patent application in such a way that it covers a broad range of alternatives, including less satisfactory options, to prevent competitors from marketing subpar products that could tarnish the reputation of the entire product genre. During the patent application process, it is import ant to respond quickly and accurately to any queries from the patent agent. This will help to keep the application on track and save time and money. As the inventor, it is also important to keep the patent agent informed of any new developments or improvem ents made to the invention, as well as any new competitors that may arise. This will help the patent agent to draft a strong and effective patent application that accurately re\ufb02ects the invention and provides maximum protection. 59 www.mitwpu.edu.in 17.

To communicate the sound recording to the public Explanation: For the purpose of this section, a copy which has been sold once shall be deemed to be a copy already in circulation. 19. How is a computer de\ufb01ned for the purpose of copyright? Computers include any electronic or similar device having information processing capabilities. 20. What is the de\ufb01nition of a computer programme? A computer programme refers to a sequence of instructions, expressed in various forms such as words, codes, schemes or other formats, that enables a computer to perform a speci\ufb01c task or achieve a particular result. This sequence of instructions may be stored on a machine -readable medium, such as a hard drive, USB drive or other similar storage device, and can be executed by a computer processor to perform various functions or tasks. In essence, a computer programme is a collection of instructions that a computer can follow to perform a speci\ufb01c task or series of tasks. 21. What is the term of a copyright? The term of copyright protection for a literary work published during the author's lifetime is the life of the author plus 60 years. This means that the copyright protection lasts for the entire lifetime of the author and for 60 years after their death. The term of copyright protection for cinematographic \ufb01lms, records, photographs, posthumous publications, anonymous publications, works of government, and international agencies is 60 years from the beginning of the calendar year following the year in which the work was published. This means that copyright protection lasts for 60 years from the year after the publication year. The term of copyright protection for broadcasting is 25 years from the beginning of the calendar year following the year in which the broadcast was made. This means that copyright protection lasts for 25 years from the year after the year in which the broadcast was made. 61 www.mitwpu.edu.in IPR POLICY IPR is a general term covering patents, registered design, trademarks, copyright, and layout design of integrated circuits, trade secrets, geographical indicators, and anti-competitive practices in contractual licenses. The Intellectual Property could be protected in the form of: Patent (to be registered) , Design Registrations (to be registered) , Trademark (registered or otherwise) , Copyright refers to the legal protection granted to the creators of original works of authorship, such as literary, artistic, and musical works, in various forms including registered or unregistered. In the context of the Institute, it may include plans, speci\ufb01cations, guidelines, graphics, training materials, software programmes, records, drawings, instruction guides, student materials, new techniques, algorithms, concepts, and other forms of creative expression. Con\ufb01dential information and technical know -how may also be protected under copy right law if they are embodied in original works of authorship. Mask works, which are designs used to create semiconductor chips, may also be protected under copyright law. Additionally, copyright protection may extend to the processes used to create works of authorship, such as the techniques used to produce a particular type of artwork or the algorithms used to generate computer programmes. Intellectual Property (IP) refers to intangible creations of the mind, such as inventions, ideas, designs, software programmes, and other forms of knowledge. It includes all results, conclusions, deductions, improvements, discoveries, solutions, processes, modi\ufb01cations, data, and information generated or produced by the faculty, staff, students, research scholars, and other employees of the Institute. IP is the result of research activities supported or sponsored by the Institute, industrial consulting, or other forms of joint research and development work. The ownership of IP resulting from such activities is determined by the Institute's IP policy. A patent application accompanied by a provisional application does not provide legal rights to the applicants. However, it is a crucial document that establishes the earliest ownership of an invention. This can be important in cases where multiple parties claim ownership of an invention. The provisional application establishes the priority date of the invention, which can be crucial in determining who has the right to \ufb01le a patent application \ufb01rst. SALIENT FEATURES OF IPR AND SERVICES PROVIDED BY IPR CELL RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 MIT-WPU C EXCEPTIONS FOR PATENT: To clarify, inventions that claim substances that are intended for use as food, medicine, or drugs, or that are capable of being used as such, are not patentable. Similarly, inventions that relate to substances that are prepared or produced by chemical processes, including alloys, optical glass, semi -conductors, and inter -metallic compounds, are also not patentable. WHETHER PATENT CAN BE REVOKED: Since a patent is granted by the state, it can also be revoked by the state under certain circumstances, even after it has been granted. It's important to note that a patent can be revoked by the state regardless of whether it has been sold or licensed in the meantime. CONTEST/CONFLICT WITH SPONSORING AGENCY: If the sponsoring agency does not cooperate in \ufb01ling a joint intellectual property rights (IPR) application, the Institute may choose to \ufb01le the application on its own with complete ownership and will bear all costs associated with securing and protecting the IPR. Copyright law protects pure or basic research, whereas patents seek to protect applied and extended research. If the intellectual property results from joint research carried out by Institute personnel and external organizations/ agencies/individuals, the ownership of the IP will be shared jointly by the Institute and the collaborators. In such cases, the Institut e will have the \ufb01rst right to commercially exploit the joint IP, regardless of whether it has been formally protected by patent(s) or not. IP COUNSELLING: The IPR cell will provide guidance and support to potential inventors of intellectual products and will assist the Institute in identifying the potential for IPR. If the cell recommends \ufb01ling for patents, the Convener/Dean R&D through the IPR cell will process the application through an approved attorney from the panel maintained by the IPR cell.

If any copyrightable work is created during sponsored or collaborative activities, ownership of the copyright will be determined by the terms and conditions outlined in the relevant contract or through mutual agreement with the sponsoring/collaborating agency. All faculty members, staff, students, research scholars (internal and external), visiting scientists, professors, and other professionals, whether full-time or part -time, can avail themselves of the services provided by the IPR cell. MIT -WPU has established sy stems and mechanisms to facilitate the commercial exploitation of the knowledge generated at the Institute under the provisions of the IPR regime in the country. SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE IPR CELL: It is crucial to respond promptly and accurately to queries from the patent agent both during the initial search and throughout the patent application process. This will facilitate the progress of the patent application and potentially save money. The IPR cell will periodically suggest patentable technologi es to potential licensing agencies, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), and other \ufb01nancial institutions, encouraging them to invest in venture capital for new technologies. 63 www.mitwpu.edu.in Is it possible to utilize the services of MIT -WPU IPR Cell to apply for a patent and get it granted? Certainly, I understand. The IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) Cell at MIT -WPU is responsible for assisting faculty members, research associates, research scholars, students, and other researchers working at MIT -WPU in obtaining patents for their inventio ns. In what proportion would the expenditure to be incurred for getting the patent granted be shared between MIT -WPU and the inventors? To clarify, if an inventor processes their patent application through MIT-WPU IPR Cell and MIT-WPU is designated as the assignee for the granted patent, then MIT-WPU is responsible for paying the fees associated with the various stages of the patent application process. In this case, the inventor is not required to pay any fees. If the expenditure to be incurred for the patenting process is fully borne by MIT-WPU, what will be royalty share for inventors after the patent is granted and we go for commercialization? As MIT-WPU is the sole applicant, there is no revenue sharing model, even for commercialized patents. Can you help us with the complete rules and regulations of the patent application and regulations followed by the MIT -WPU IPR Cell? Please go through the links \u2018frequently asked questions\u2019 and \u2018IPR Policy\u2019 under \u201cIPR Cell\u201d link at MIT-WPU Website. Is it possible to apply for a patent as an individual without help from MIT -WPU? To put it another way, if the invention is the result of work conducted by a researcher during their time at MIT-WPU and if the facilities provided by MIT -WPU were utilized in the creation of the invention, then it is expected that the inventor will \ufb01le their patent application through the MIT -WPU IPR Cell and designate MIT -WPU as the assignee. If the patent application is not processed through MIT -WPU IPR Cell, will MIT -WPU still \ufb01nancially support the patenting process? To rephrase, if the inventor chooses not to apply for a patent through the MIT-WPU IPR Cell, then MIT-WPU will not assume any responsibility for the costs associated with the patenting process. What is the documentation to be submitted to IPR Cell and what is the mode of submission, when one makes a beginning with patenting his invention? The Inventor is required to submit their proposal in the format of an Invention Disclosure Form (IDF) when making their proposal. It's important to note that the format of the IDF differs depending on whether it is for a patent or a design registration. The blank IDF for patent or design registration can be downloaded from the IPR Cell link on the MIT -WPU website. It's worth noting that there have been instances where Inventors have submitted Forms 1, 2, 3, and 5 of the Indian Patents Act 1970 as part of their proposal. However, it's important to remember that these forms are not required to be submitted to the IPR Cell. Instead, only the IDF is necessary for submitting the proposal. If the proposal is for a design registration, the Inventors must enter into an \"Agreement on Designs\" with MIT -WPU on a non -judicial stamp paper worth Rs. 20. A template for the agreement can be downloaded from the IPR Cell link on the MIT -WPU website. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ) RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 MIT-WPU C Which are the points which need particular attention, while \ufb01lling in the Invention Disclosure Form (IDF) for patents? The following points in IDF require particular attention: Point 8: General area of the patent: Please be speci\ufb01c.

The policy encompasses all forms of research that involve human participants, their tissues, or data, and should also be applied more broadly to activities such as enterprise and innovation, or service evaluation and audit, where ethical issues may arise. These policies are applicable to all research conducted by MIT-WPU's faculty and students. For studies that have obtained external ethical approval, there is no need to repeat the process. The appropriate University Ethics Committee must be informed and provided with a copy of the approval. The Ethics Committee will con\ufb01rm that no additional approval is necessary for the study. This policy is applicable to all individuals conducting research either within the University or on behalf of it. This includes staff, individuals with honorary University appointments, visiting researchers, undergraduate and postgraduate students, as well as visiting scholars and students. When a research project is being carried out by academics from multiple institutions, the lead institution (usually the institution where the Principal Investigator is employed) should seek the relevant ethical clearance for the project, and other partner institutions should be informed of any outcomes and issues. PURPOSE The aim of this policy and procedure is to establish and promote the highest ethical standards in academic research. The University is dedicated to safeguarding the rights, dignity, safety, and privacy of research subjects, as well as the well -being of animals, and ensuring environmental protection. Additionally, the University is committed to minimizing health and safety risks for researchers and upholding their academic freedom. The Institutional Ethics Committee of MIT-WPU will evaluate and approve all research proposals involving human participants, taking into account the welfare and safety of actual and potential research participants. The goals of research, no matter how important, should never be prioritized over the health and well -being of the research subjects. GUIDELINES Researchers af\ufb01liated with MIT-WPU must seek approval from the Ethics Committee. The ethical review process should ensure adherence to the following policy documents of MIT-WPU. a. Policy for Promotion of Research b. Plagiarism Policy c. Patent Policy d. Consultancy Policy ETHICS COMMITTEE 77 www.mitwpu.edu.in The University mandates an ethical review of all research projects that involve primary research with human subjects (or their data), regardless of funding source. In most cases, a review would be conducted by a Research Ethics Committee. Projects involving living persons, human tissues, or data related to recently deceased persons, as well as projects involving animals (including animals living in their natural habitats), must have genuine research, educational, or training purpose. Ethical approval is required for all research involving human participants, human material, or human data. Howe ver, research that uses information about human participants that is publicly and lawfully available, such as census data, population statistics, court reports, and personal letters or diaries in public libraries, is exempt from this requirement. The University has a Code of Ethics for Research that includes funda mental principles to protect human participants. The University requires that all research falling under this policy must adhere to the Code of Ethics and its fundamental principles. The University's policies,",

Projects involving living persons, human tissues, or data related to recently deceased persons, as well as projects involving animals (including animals living in their natural habitats), must have genuine research, educational, or training purpose. Ethical approval is required for all research involving human participants, human material, or human data. Howe ver, research that uses information about human participants that is publicly and lawfully available, such as census data, population statistics, court reports, and personal letters or diaries in public libraries, is exempt from this requirement. The University has a Code of Ethics for Research that includes funda mental principles to protect human participants. The University requires that all research falling under this policy must adhere to the Code of Ethics and its fundamental principles. The University's policies, committees, and sub -committees must consider the relevant professional ethical codes and research sponsor policies. If there is a difference in ethical standards between the University policy and the relevant professional body or research sponsor, the committees should apply the highest standard of ethical practice. Research ethics committees should be appropriate to the disciplinary mix of research they will review, comply with speci\ufb01c funding or professional body requirements, and comply with relevant legislative requirements. They should also consider the anticipated volume of work. Every research ethics committee should not only take the responsibility of reviewing and approving all research within its jurisdiction but also create and endorse research ethics toolkits. These toolkits should include standard consent forms, participant information sheets, and protocols for ensuring security, con\ufb01dentiality, anonymization, and retention o f data. It is essential for all research ethics committees to maintain detailed records of their proceedings and decisions. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 MIT-WPU C APPLICATION AND APPEALS PROCEDURE APPLICATIONS FOR ETHICAL APPROVAL The Institutional Research Ethics Board ethical committee will consider the following matters when reviewing applications for ethical approval, considering their relevance to the research project: The risk of physical, emotional, or reputational harm to research participants, and the steps that will be taken to minimize or mitigate these risks. The risk of physical or emotional harm to the researcher, and the steps that will be taken to minimize or mitigate these risks. The procedures for recruiting research participants and obtaining their informed consent, including the provision of participant information sheets and consent forms. The rationale for using observation or covert surveillance, or any other methods that may not be transparent to research participants. The measures that will be taken to ensure the security and con\ufb01dentiality of personal data and any human tissues or artefacts collected for the project, particularly those that will be stored or processed off-site. The arrangements for the retention, anonymization, and disposal of personal data, artefacts, or tissues at the end of the project, or as required by research sponsors or legal provisions. The procedures for debrie\ufb01ng research participants, particularly in cases where the research may have caused them distress. The procedures for reporting and dealing with any adverse reactions to the research project. The measures that will be taken to ensure that appropriate Ethical Board checks are conducted when researchers are working in settings where children or vulnerable adults may be present. If ethical approval is not granted or if signi\ufb01cant modi\ufb01cations are required for the proposed research, the Institutional Research Ethics Board must provide detailed written feedback to the applicant. In the case of research students, the feedback must also be provided to their Director of Studies or Lead Supervisor, as appropriate. If the issue cannot be resolved informally, applicants have the right to appeal. APPEALS If there are statutory requirements that specify different procedures for appeals, these will take precedence over the appeals procedures outlined in this Policy. Researchers who are bound by their own professional code of conduct should be aware that their own ethics policies may be more rigorous than those outlined in this Policy, and they must comply with their professional codes. Failure to comply with ethics approval may be deemed as serious professional misconduct, which the university is obligated to report to the researcher's professional body. 79 www.mitwpu.edu.in INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH ETHICS BOARD The university shall establish an Institutional Research Ethics Board to ensure that research activities conducted by researchers are fully compliant with the university's regulations on research ethics and the protectio n of human and non- human subjects involved in research.

The university has an obligation to safeguard public funds and ensure that it delivers the assured value for mo ney to its students and other beneficiaries. The Tuition Fee Policy forms part of the university\u2019s Terms and Conditions and should be read in conjunction with them, for together they provide the comprehensive framework for the setting, payment, collection, and reconciliation of tuition fees. Course fees include all compulsory elements needed for students to meet the minimum learning outcomes of the course. In some courses, optional additional costs may be incurred. The purpose of this policy is to set out the tuition fee liability that applies to students upon enrolment on a course/programme of study. Scope This policy relates to: \u27a2 Student tuition fee liability This policy does not relate to: \u27a2 Non-refundable tuition fee deposits \u27a2 Accommodation fees 37 | P a g e Policy \u27a2 All students bear a personal liability for the tuition fee associated with any course/programme of study for which they enrol. \u27a2 All students must enrol for each successive year or another relevant part of their course/courses at MIT World Peace University no later than 30 days after the stating date of the respective course/courses). o Upon non -completion of enrolment by/before the prescribed deadline dates, students will be withdrawn from their ongoing course. Once withdrawn, the students\u2019 ID card will be deactivated following which they will not be able to attend lectures, use the libr ary, submit, or sit for assessments or take part in any other academic activity. \u27a2 The University has a ' fixed fee ' policy for tuition fee meaning that the fee charged at the beginning of the programme remains the same throughout that particular programme. \u27a2 The ' fixed fee ' policy will apply even if a student interrupts or repeats another year of study. \u27a2 It is the students\u2019 responsibility to ensure that they will be able to pay for their entire course duration prior to enrolment. \u27a2 Enrolment will not be permitted unless any/all outstanding debt(s) from the previous year has been paid in full or an instalment plan has been agreed upon by the university\u2019s Fee Team. \u27a2 IMPORTANT: Students are legally responsible for payment of their complete tuition fee themselves, whether they have an SLC loan or a sponsor. If the sponsor does not pay the university, or if the students find out that they are not eligible for a SLC loan, or they lose 38 | P a g e their eligibility for an SLC loan at any time after the commencement of the course, the students will be liable to pay their own fees for any/all periods of study that is not paid for by a sponsor or the SLC. This applies to all forms of undergraduate and postgraduate fee. \u27a2 Students who are considering discontinuing their programme of study are encouraged to first consult with the University for Advice and Guidance before making the final decision to leave. Further information on the range of support available can be found on the university website. \u27a2 In all cases, wherein a student withdraws from or discontinues their studies, or is granted a period of leave of absence from their studies, the date of withdrawal/discontinuation/leave of absence is accounted for by the university towards calculating the cumulative tuition fee liability. \u27a2 For students who are sponsored, in the event of the sponsor not making payment in respect of the tuition fees, the student will be personally liable for the payment. \u27a2 Students funded by the Student Loans Company (SLC) will be liable for payment of either 50% or 100% of the tuition fee loan, in line with SLC policy in case of discontinuation mid - programme. For undergraduate students starting in August, the liability will stand at 50% in case the withdrawal takes place before course commencement & remaining 50% will be liable after completion of 90 days from the course commencement date. \u27a2 The university reserves the right to take appropriate action against students who fail to pay their fees, or make satisfactory arrangements to pay on, or by the end of a set period after the starting date of their course. When to pay fees: Students either can make the full payment or can opt for the payment in instalments as per the fee payment schedule declared and published by the university. First Installment Fee will have to be paid in full for the seat to be confirmed in candidate \u2019s name (no parti al payments are permitted) . How to pay fees: 39 | P a g e The University is committed to offering a simplified payment experience, which is both secure and safe.

Awards Funding Amount: 25K to 3L Duration of Project: 6 months to 3 years (Progress evaluation after every 6 months) Selection Criteria The R&D Cell will issue a call for proposals once a year, and individual faculty or a group of faculties along with the student members can submit their applications. An innovation screening committee will be established to review the proposals according to a prede\ufb01ned process, and the committee will make recommendations or non-recommendations for individual projects. The endorsement of an innovation project will depend on the innovation funds resulting in a solution for current technical and social challenges that eventually leads to the generation of intellectual property that can be marketed and has potent ial for commercial success through technology transfer. Teams of students are also eligible to apply for innovation funds. The teams will be required to present their ideas before a panel of experts and industry sponsors, following a \u2018Shark Tank\u2019 model.

Alongside its undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, MIT -WPU also encourages its faculty members and academic staff to undertake consultancy projects with industry and other institutions. This not only expands and strengthens the research pro\ufb01le of MIT-WPU but also creates new knowledge and broadens the experience of faculty and staff members. This document provid es a formal framework to guide the implementation of this process. AIM OF THE DOCUMENT MIT-WPU aims to be a university that fosters innovation and is committed to adopting best practices in its engagement with external organizations. The university rec ognizes that consultancy work and external activity undertaken by its staff are crucial and valuable aspects of its operations. MIT-WPU believes that such activities are essential for knowledge exchange and can result in mutually bene\ufb01cial outcomes for both, the university and external organizations. To support its staff in the delivery of approved consultancy work, MIT -WPU has established a policy that outlines the procedures and guidelines to be followed. This policy is a part of the university's human resources management procedures and forms a part of the contract of employment for the academic staff. PURPOSE The objective of this policy is to establish the rules and regulations that govern consultancy and other external service s provided by the staff of MIT -WPU. MIT-WPU acknowledges the signi\ufb01cance of its staff engaging in consultancy for external organizations, particularly for the industry. MIT -WPU recognizes this as a vital medium through which knowledge and expertise can be shared with and from businesses and other external agencies, thereby promoting the development of mutually bene\ufb01cial relationships with these organizations. Thus, MIT -WPU promotes and supports its staff members to under take consultancy and similar work, as long as it does not contradict the interests of MIT -WPU. It is expected by MIT -WPU that external consultancy engagement will be undertaken with the highest levels of professionalism and integrity by staff members. MIT-WPU expects that the consultancy work will contribute to the development of mutually bene\ufb01cial relationships with external organizations, including industry bodies, and that it will further enhance the knowledge and expertise of staff members, thus supporting the overall development of MIT-WPU. The policy aims to provide guidance and support to staf f members in undertaking consultancy work in a way that is consistent with the interests of MIT-WPU and ensures transparency, ethical practice, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations. Benefits of engagement: External consultancy provides an opportunity for the staff members to increase their professional and/or academic competence and experience, and a chance for continuing professional education by working with industry. Engaging in external consultancy can help to create and su stain relationships between MIT -WPU and external organizations, leading to bene\ufb01ts such as increased research opportunities, student admission and placement, and ultimately contributing to knowledge exchange for the bene\ufb01t of the country. External consultancy can also generate additional income for the staff members and increased funding for MIT-WPU. MIT-WPU CONSULTANCY POLICY RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 24 www.mitwpu.edu.in APPLICABILITY MIT-WPU aims to promote and support consultancy work among its staff members in accordance with the University's employment policies and regulations. Academic staff are encouraged to engage in consultancy work that aligns with their respective disciplines and does not hinder their primary role within their department. This policy is applicable to all academic, academic -related, and administrative staff members of MIT-WPU and is to be adhered to in uniformity.

If issues are problematic, approval of the Pro-Vice Chancellor/Vice Chancellor shall be sought before \ufb01nal sign -off. If a client insists on an agreement on their terms, R&D will review the Client's terms and conditions, in consultation with the Legal Department of MIT-WPU, for acceptance or renegotiation. Any agreement outside of the approved standard terms and conditions can only be entered into after approval from MIT-WPU's management and shall be done by R&D. EARNINGS DISTRIBUTION MODEL The distribution model is based on income per consultancy agreement per \ufb01nancial year. Sr. No. Earnings PI & Team** MIT-WPU 1 Intellectual Consultancy 80% 20% 2 MIT-WPU Consultancy 70% 30% 3 Testing and Evaluation 60% 40% 4 Standardization and Calibration 60% 40% **The applicable income tax and other statutory taxes will be deducted from the staff's payment, and they will receive only the net amount after deductions. The payment cannot be given in cash or any other form for personal bene\ufb01t and will be paid only ele ctronically into the individual's salary bank account. The share mentioned is in addition to the individual's regular salary. Each Consultancy Agreement contract will have a unique price that will be determined on a case -by-case basis, taking into consideration the client and the nature of the project. The maximum consultancy income permissible for a staff member under the standard distribution model shall not exceed their total salary for the year, which includes basic pay and standard allowances like dearness allowance but does not include other payments such as ex-gratia, monetary or non-monetary awards. This limit applies in any \ufb01nancial year, and any amount exceeding this limit shall be deposited into MIT -WPU's Research Fund. The creation of teaching and academic materials as well as other publications such as books and articles in a consultancy project will be subject to MIT-WPU's Policy on Intellectual Property. 29 MIT-WPU C CLARIFICATIONS For all matters not covered in this document, as a general principle, Dean R&D / Director R&D may be approached for clari\ufb01cations required, if any. GENERAL All payments made for consultancy services must be processed through MIT -WPU's designated bank a ccount. This means that payments should be made in the name of MIT -WPU and not directly to individual faculty members. MIT-WPU will ensure compliance with statutory laws and distribute the appropriate share to the faculty/staff involved in the consultancy project. The client shall not be provided with a detailed breakdown of the consultancy charges, and only a lump sum \ufb01gure of the total consultancy charges may be quoted. Nevertheless, the working sheet must be kept as part of the internal records and may be subject to an internal audit as deemed necessary. The consultancy agreement must comply with the laws of India as per t he Standardized Terms and Conditions. However, in exceptional circumstances and with proper approvals, compliance with both local and international laws may be considered. The Principal Investigator (PI) is solely responsible for completing the project and delivering the agreed -upon deliverables. MIT-WPU only provides necessary support to the PI. After the completion of the project, the Principal Investigator (PI) shall provide a Final Project Completion Report (PCR) to the funding agency. Additionally, two copies of the report shall be submitted to the R&D Cell for record keeping. To ensure the project account can be closed by the Finance Department of MIT-WPU, it is important to obtain a Completion Certi\ufb01cate (CC) from the funding agency to con\ufb01rm the successful completion of the project. Testing and evaluation services can be provided to ful\ufb01ll the requirements of governmental and associated organizations, speci\ufb01c clients, and external educational institutions. MIT-WPU may provide Standardization and Calibration services in areas where the necessary facilities are available or can be expanded. It is recommended that these services be supported by regular calibration and standardization of the laboratory equipment used for these purposes. For signi\ufb01cant projects where the consultancy value exceeds Rs. 5 Lakhs (Rupees Five Lakhs only), payments may be accepted against agreed -upon milestones with appropriate prior approvals. However, for smaller projects or daily consultancy work, payments must be obtained in advance from the client(s). In exceptional situations where the assigned PI is unable to complete the consultancy work undertaken by MIT-WPU, MIT-WPU retains the authority to reassign the consultancy to another investigator. If completing the consultancy is deemed impossible or unfeasible by MIT-WPU, the Approver will address the matter with the client to close the project.

The project account will be handled by the faculty or principal investigator (PI), who will spend the funds as required. The institute's share should also be transferred. The requirement for a consultancy project/task/work can originate from the industry or other organizations concerned, or the faculty can approach the industry or other organizations. The faculty is expected to estimate the time and cost required to accompl ish the task. A proposal is then prepared by the principal investigator (PI). The budget for the proposal should be in one part and re\ufb02ect the project consultancy fee for the principal investigator (PI), co -PI, and other investigators, 50% overheads to MIT -WPU, and service tax on the total amount if applicable. Service tax is subject to periodic revision by the Government of India. Service tax is not applicable on projects if the funds are received in foreign currency. Expenses for equipment, supporting manpower, travel, and contingency must also be included in the budget, if necessary.

GENERAL GUIDELINES Limitations: Involving Foreign Collaborators: Publications of Results: Performing regular testing tasks should be discouraged. Additionally, it is important to exercise caution and ensure that consultancy projects do not hinder the regular duties of faculty members. The proposals that involve foreign collaborators must comply with the National Laws, Rules, Regulations, and procedures in effect regarding funding support to each partner. Researchers who wish to publish technical or scienti\ufb01c papers based on the project 's research work should follow the sponsoring agency's guidelines and acknowledge the agency's assistance in the publications. If the research results are to be legally protected, the investigators should take necessary steps to secure legal protection for the research results before publishing them. External Consultants External consultants may be engaged to provide comprehensive services to clients, but their in Consul tancy Projects: Con\ufb02ict of Interest: Consultants: Exceptions: utilization will be limited. They will be entitled to receive a lump sum honorarium or fee, which should not exceed 30% of the total consultancy fee speci\ufb01ed in the Consultancy Projects Proposal. Consultants are required to disclose in writing to the Dean R&D any relationship they may have with the client funding the consultancy project or any vendor to whom payments are made from project funds, such as the involvement of immediate relatives, or any potential scope for dispro - portionate self -gain. A commi ttee will review such cases and advise the Dean R&D to ensure that there is no actual con\ufb02ict of interest, and that the consultant's involvement does not compromise their objectivity, integrity, or commitment to the Institute and the profession. Consultants are prohibited from using the name of the Institute or their af\ufb01liation with the Institute in a way that (i) implies that the Institute endorses or opposes a product or service provided by a pro\ufb01t, non- pro\ufb01t, or government entity, (ii) suggests that the Institute has conducted research or released research \ufb01ndings when it has not done so, or presents the results of Institute research in a misleading manner, or (iii) could be perceived as conveying the of\ufb01cial position of the Institute on any matter of public interest. Book royalty and honorarium for services like Expert Committee meetings, invited lectures, Ph.D. viva/evaluation, invited training programmes, organization of conferences/workshops are not considered part of the consultancy services. 43 C MIT-WPU RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 44 www.mitwpu.edu.in PREAMBLE MIT World Peace University, hereafter referred to as MIT-WPU/Institute, has been striving for the last 40 years to develop a pool of high -quality scienti\ufb01c and technical professionals and provide solutions to various challenging technological issues that may arise in different \ufb01elds. The Institute is supported by well - quali\ufb01ed faculty and highly skilled staff, committed to be coming a premier center of teaching, research, and extension in Engineering and Technology. The Institute fosters academic excellence, innovation, and encourages scholarship and research. The MIT World Peace University recognizes the value of intangible assets such as inventions, copyrights, know -how, designs, and other creative and innovative products resulting from the intellectual and scienti\ufb01c endeavors of its faculty and students, whic h provide a competitive advantage to the Institute. To provide guidance on the practices and rules regarding intellectual property rights (IPR), ownership, commercial exploitation, technology transfer, and con\ufb01dentiality requirements, the Institute has for mulated its intellectual property policy. The policy aims to create an environment conducive to curiosity -driven and market -driven research and development activities, as well as the creation of original works of authorship, for the bene\ufb01t of the Institute, its faculty, staff, students, research scholars, and external agencies. It should be emphasized that this IPR policy should be considered as a guide rather than a rigid regulation in the legal sense, given the constantly evolving landscape of the national IPR policy, and may be subject to modi\ufb01cations if necessary. This document, along with the accompanying addendum (Operating guidelines) and annexures (providing useful information on Patents and Copyright), is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the Intellectual Property (IP) management framework at MIT -WPU. PURPOSE The purpose of the IPR policy of MIT-WPU is to: The primary objective of MIT -WPU's intellectual property policy is to facilitate, encourage, promote and",

To provide guidance on the practices and rules regarding intellectual property rights (IPR), ownership, commercial exploitation, technology transfer, and con\ufb01dentiality requirements, the Institute has for mulated its intellectual property policy. The policy aims to create an environment conducive to curiosity -driven and market -driven research and development activities, as well as the creation of original works of authorship, for the bene\ufb01t of the Institute, its faculty, staff, students, research scholars, and external agencies. It should be emphasized that this IPR policy should be considered as a guide rather than a rigid regulation in the legal sense, given the constantly evolving landscape of the national IPR policy, and may be subject to modi\ufb01cations if necessary. This document, along with the accompanying addendum (Operating guidelines) and annexures (providing useful information on Patents and Copyright), is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the Intellectual Property (IP) management framework at MIT -WPU. PURPOSE The purpose of the IPR policy of MIT-WPU is to: The primary objective of MIT -WPU's intellectual property policy is to facilitate, encourage, promote and safeguard scienti\ufb01c inquiry, research pursuits and academic freedom of its faculty, researchers and students. The Institute aims to foster a culture of innovation that encourages the creation and development of intellectual property within its premises.; The policy aims to provide a clear understanding of the rights and responsibilities of the faculty, staff, and students regarding intellectual property and to protect the interests of the Institute and its members. One of the objectives of the MIT-WPU IPR policy is to establish a comprehensive management policy and procedural guidelines for converting the knowledge generated within the Institute to wealth. This involves the identi\ufb01cation, protection, management, and commercialization of intellectual property assets, such as patents, copyrights, and trademar ks, with the aim of generating income for the Institute and its members. The policy also includes guidelines for technology transfer, licensing agreements, and spin -off companies, as well as procedures for resolving disputes related to IPR. The primary objective of the IPR policy is to enable the Institute to make effective and bene\ufb01cial use of the intellectual property created by its members, in order to maximize the bene\ufb01ts to the inventors, the Institute, and the society as a whole. The aim is to establish the Institute as a leading academic research center that upholds the highest standards of scholarship and teaching. This can be achieved by disseminating the bene\ufb01ts of intellectual property generated at the Institute to the communi ty and society. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (POLICY AND GUIDELINES) OBJECTIVES The IPR policy of the Institute aims to: The Institute aims to protect and enhance the value of intellectual property created by its faculty, staff, and students during their tenure at the Institute. This will provide opportunities for wealth generation, alleviation of human suffering, and improvement of human life. The objective is to promote awareness and culture of IPR among the faculty, staff, and students of the Institute by implementing prudent IP management practices. Establish a centralized and comprehensive reference system to address all IPR related issues in a streamlined and ef\ufb01cient manner, making it easier for faculty, staff, and students to access infor mation and receive guidance. The IPR policy of the Institute aims to proactively create an environment that fosters the generation of new knowledge through research and innovations, while also aligning with the educational mission of the Institute. SCOPE This policy applies to all forms of intellectual property resulting from the intellectual and scienti\ufb01c pursuits of the following individuals: faculty members, staff, students, research scholars (both internal and external), individuals employed in sponsored research and consultancy projects, visiting scientists/professors/professionals who contribute to the teaching and research wor k conducted at the Institute, whether full -time or part -time, regardless of whether these rights are eligible for registration. The intellectual property generated from academic research encompasses patents, designs, copyright, know -how, and con\ufb01dential in formation. POLICY STATEMENT The Institute is dedicated to balancing the promotion, protection, management, and commercialization of intellectual property while also maintaining its core values of teaching, research, and community service. It acknowledg es the importance of commercializing and exploiting intellectual property for generating additional revenue for the Institute and offering bene\ufb01ts to its staff and students. However, the Institute also acknowledges the signi\ufb01cance of traditional academic v alues and expectations. DEFINITIONS Intellectual Property (IP) refers to intangible knowledge products and encompasses all types of results, conclusions, deductions, inventions, ideas, improvements, discoveries, enhancements, solutions, processes, modi\ufb01cations, know -how, data, and informatio n that are conceived, generated, made, or reduced to practice by the faculty, staff, students, research scholars, and other employees of the Institute. This includes designs, software programmes, genetically engineered microorganisms, business models, and copyrightable works that result from their intellectual output. IP is the result of research supported or sponsored by the Institute, industrial consulting, or other collaborative research and development efforts. Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) refers to the legal rights that are granted to individuals or entities for their creative and innovative works. These rights are derived from various forms of intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. IPR grants exclusive rights to the creators or owners of intellectual property, allowing them to contr ol the use, distribution, and commercialization of their creations. This ensures that they are able to bene\ufb01t \ufb01nancially from their work and encourages further innovation and creativity. Some examples of IPR include the following: Patents: These are legal protections granted to inventors for their new and useful inventions or discoveries. They give the inventor the exclusive right to manufacture, use, and sell the invention for a certain period. 45 C MIT-WPU RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 46 www.mitwpu.edu.in Trademarks: Copyrights: Trade Secrets: These are symbols, logos, or phrases used to identify and distinguish a particular product or service from others.

Trademarks protect the brand iden tity of a company or individual and prevent others from using similar marks that could confuse consumers. These are legal protections granted to authors, artists, and creators for their original works of expression, such as books, music, \ufb01lms, and software. Copyrights give the creator the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, and display their work. These are con\ufb01dential business information or practices that give a company a competitive advantage. Trade secret protection prevents others from using or disclosing secret information without permission. Overall, IPR plays a crucial role in protecting and incentivizing innovation and creativity by providing legal protections an d \ufb01nancial rewards for the creators and owners of intellectual property. Background information the term \"background information\" in a Collaborative Research and Development programme refers to the technical knowledge and expertise that is owned or controlled by the programme partners before the commencement of the programme. This information is typically in the same \ufb01eld as the programme's subject matter or in related \ufb01elds that are necessary for the successful execution of the programme. The term \"Institute Personnel\" as used in this policy document encompasses a wide range of individuals including but not limited to full-time and part -time faculty members, staff, students, research scholars (both internal and external), visiting scientists, professors, and other professionals who are employed or engaged by the institute. OWNERSHIP OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Whenever the Institute \ufb01les an application for ownership of intellectual property rights, it is require d to acknowledge and mention all individuals who have made signi\ufb01cant intellectual contributions to the creation or invention in question. These individuals must be identi\ufb01ed as inventors or creators in the application. Copyrights The ownership of copyright on all teaching and instructional materials created by employees of the Institute as part of any academic programmes or activities shall belong to the Institute. However, the author(s) of such materials shall retain the right to use the materials in their professional work. This clause does not apply to books, articles, monographs, speeches, and other works produced by the Institute staff members during research and teaching, using Institute resources. The Institute acknowledges and recognizes that the faculty members own the copyright to such traditional works of authorship. In situations where Institute employees have created copyrightable works, including software, using. signi\ufb01cant Institute resources, the Institute may require the employees to assign some or all of the copyright to such works. The extent to which the Institute's resources have been used to produce the copyrightable work will determine the extent of the assignment of the copyright. The Institute shall have ownership of the copyright of works created by non-Institute personnel who are engaged or associated with any Institute activity, regardless of whether Institute personnel have made intellectual contributions to such works or not. In cases where copyrightable works are created during sponsored or collaborative activities, the ownership of copyright shall be determined either in accordance with the terms and conditions related to intellectual property speci\ufb01ed in the contract governing such activity (if any), or through mutual consultations and agreement between the Institute and the sponsoring/collaborating agency. 47 www.mitwpu.edu.in In the case of a thesis, dissertation, or project report written by a student, the ownership of copyright shall be jointly held by the student and their guide. However, the Institute may demand the full assignment of the copyright in such cases. In cases where the Institute does not demand the assignment of copyright or where the copyright has not been assigned to the Institute, the Institute shall be entitled to a non -exclusive, non -transferable lic ense to use the work within the Institute for non-commercial educational and research purposes. Additionally, the Institute may possess a limited number of copies of the work for such purposes. Unless otherwise speci\ufb01ed in the original contract for the work, any copyrightable work that is generated as a work -for-hire shall normally belong to the Institute. If the Institute anticipates a potential \ufb01nancial gain from any copyrights, it may take steps to \ufb01le and protect such copyrights and share the result ing \ufb01nancial bene\ufb01ts with the creator(s) according to the terms and conditions established by the Institute. Institute - Supported Research All intellectual property rights arising from investigations conducted at the Institute using the Institute's resources shall belong to and be the exclusive property of the Institute, except in cases where such investigations are conduct - ed jointly with o ther institutions and agencies or are sponsored by an outside agency. Sponsored Research The intellectual property rights (IPR) of inventions resulting from research projects that are carried out on behalf of and fully funded by a sponsoring agency shall be registered jointly in the name of the Institute and the sponsoring agency if the cost of securing and maintaining the IPR registration is shared equally between the Institute and the sponsoring agency.

Institute - Supported Research All intellectual property rights arising from investigations conducted at the Institute using the Institute's resources shall belong to and be the exclusive property of the Institute, except in cases where such investigations are conduct - ed jointly with o ther institutions and agencies or are sponsored by an outside agency. Sponsored Research The intellectual property rights (IPR) of inventions resulting from research projects that are carried out on behalf of and fully funded by a sponsoring agency shall be registered jointly in the name of the Institute and the sponsoring agency if the cost of securing and maintaining the IPR registration is shared equally between the Institute and the sponsoring agency. However, if the sponsoring agency is not willing to share the costs of registration and maintenance, the IPR shall belong exclusively to the Institute. If the sponsoring agency is not willing to share the cost of securing and maintaining the IPR registration for jointly \ufb01led applications, the Institute may, at its discretion, \ufb01le the application with sole ownership and bear the entire cost of securing and protecting the IPR. In cases where the research project is only partially funded by the sponsoring agency or if there are multiple sponsors for the same project, the sharing of IPR shall be determined through mutual consultations and appropriate agreements between the Institute and the sponsoring agency(ies). If the sponsoring agency is an industry, they may choose one of the following options for sharing the IPR with the Institute: The Institute may enter into an agreement with the sponsoring industry where the ownership of IPR will rest with the industry. However, the industry will have to pay the Institute an initial lump sum and reasonable annual royalties for a speci\ufb01c period as recognition of the Institute's contribution to the project. The terms of ownership of the IPR will be governed by a speci\ufb01c prior agreement between the Institute and the sponsoring industry. The ownership of IPR rested in the sponsoring industry may be exclusive or non -exclusive. In case of exclusive ownership, if the industrial sponsor fails to exploit within a mutually agreed time limit, the Institute may permit third -party exploitation of the IPR. The Institute shall retain ownership of the IPR, but the industrial sponsor shall have the right to exploit the IPR either exclusively or non-exclusively. This right will be granted in exchang e for an initial lump sum payment, subsequent annual royalties for a speci\ufb01ed period, or other bene\ufb01ts to the Institute as mutually agreed upon. In cases of exclusive exploitation rights, if the industrial sponsor fails to exploit the IPR within an agreed -upon time limit, third -party exploitation may be permitted. The Institute shall retain user rights for the purposes of further research and development. The terms of ownership and exploitation rights will be governed by a speci\ufb01c prior agreement between the Institute and the sponsoring industry. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 Joint Research In the case of intellectual property resulting from joint research conducted by Institute personnel with external organizations/agencies/individuals, the ownership of the IP will be jointly shared by the Institute and the collaborators. The cost of \ufb01ling a nd maintaining the IPR as well as the revenue generated from its commercial exploitation will be shared by both parties according to an agreed -upon formula. If the collaborators do not agree to share the cost, the Institute may decide at its discretion to \ufb01le and maintain the IPR at its own expense. In such cases, the sharing of revenue resulting from the commercial exploitation of the IPR will be determined solely by the Institute. Technology Transfer The Institute will make all efforts to commercially exploit the IPR obtained, either solely or jointly with other agencies, to the fullest extent reasonably possible and without unnecessary delay. The marketing of the IPR will be conducted through technology transfer agreements, licensing (both exclusive and non-exclusive), and revenue -sharing models. The Institute will attempt to \ufb01nd potential licensees to commercially exploit the intellectual property (IP) that it owns outright. If the IP is jointly owned, the Institute will offer the \ufb01rst opportunity to commercially exploit it to the joint owners, regardless of whether the IP is protected by patents or not. This licensing agreement would require a lump sum payment as a technology transfer fee, as well as ongoing royalty payments for an agreed -upon period from the start of commercial exploitation. If the joint owner declines this option, the Institute will move forward with commercializing the IP in a manner it sees \ufb01t. If the other collaborating organization or industry does not undertake commercial exploitation within two years from the initial development of the technology, the Institute retains the right to license the use of the intellectual property to a third party. The Institute may support entrepreneurial activities among its staff by transferring ownership of an intellectual property to the inventor(s) or creator(s) of the property, through an agreement. This will enable the staff member s to market, protect, and license the intellectual property independently, with minimal involvement from the Institute. The Institute requires the assignee to pay all expenses related to patenting and licensing, as well as any royalties, equity, or other value received by the inventor(s) or creator(s). The Institute would make efforts to commercialize intellectual property, either through its own means or by hiring a Technology Management Agency to develop the IP created by its staff.

After a speci\ufb01ed period, the inventor(s) or creator(s) may request that the Institute transfer the rights to them. Revenue Sharing The sole applicant for any intellectual property (IP) generated at MIT-WPU will be the institute itself, and no sharing of revenue will occur, even if the IP is commercialized. However, in cases where the institute chooses to transfer the IP rights to the inventor(s)/creator(s), the inventor(s)/creator(s) will be required to reimburse the institute for all costs incurred in protecting, maintaining, marketing, and otherwise associated with the IP. 48 C MIT-WPU 49 www.mitwpu.edu.in Infringements, Damages, Liability, and Indemnity Insurance As a policy, the Institute will require any licensee to provide indemni\ufb01cation against any legal proceedings, including but not limited to those arising from manufacturing defects, production problems, design guarantees, and obligations related to upgrades and debugging, in any contract between the licensee and the Institute. The Institute will include an indemnity clause in agreements with licensees when transferring technology or copyrighted material, to protect its personne l. The Institute will also retain the right to decide whether or not to engage in any litigation concerning patents and license infringements. Conflict of Interest Inventors must disclose any con\ufb02icts of interest or potential con\ufb02icts of interest. If the inventor(s) or their immediate family have a stake in a licensee or potential licensee company, they must disclose the stake they or their immediate family have in the company. In the case of a license or an assignment of rights for a patent to a company where the inventor(s) have a stake, the approval of the IPR Cell will be required. Dispute Resolution If there are any disputes between the Institute and the inventors concerning the implementation of the IP policy, the aggrieved party can appeal to the Vice Chancellor of the Institute. The Institute will make efforts to address the concerns of the aggrieved party. However, the decision of the Chancellor will be \ufb01nal and binding in this matter. APPLICATION OF POLICY This policy is considered a part of the conditions of employment for every employee of the Institute, as well as a condition of enrollment and attendance for students at the Institute. The policy applies to all existing staff and students upon enrollment. Bottom of Form The Institute retains the right to amend the IPR Policy as necessary or deemed appropriate. All potential cre ators who use Institute -sponsored resources or participate in a sponsored research project must comply with this policy and accept the principles of intellectual property ownership outlined in this policy, unless an exception is approved in writing by the Institute. RIGHT TO REGULATE POLICY The IPR Cell is responsible for interpreting the policy, resolving disputes, and applying the policy. The cell may also recommend changes to the policy p eriodically to the Registrar and Vice Chancellor, who will make decisions on any suggested changes. The IPR policy may be reviewed every three years, or earlier if there is a signi\ufb01cant change in the national policy. LEGAL JURISDICTION As a policy, all ag reements signed by the Institute and any resulting disputes will be subject to the legal jurisdiction of the Court of Adjudication in Pune only. These agreements will be governed by the appropriate laws of India.

IP PROTECTION -SOME EXPLANATORY NOTES (To be read in conjunction with MIT-WPU IPR\u2013Annexure: some useful information on patents and copyright) Intellectual property can take various forms such as patents, industrial designs, trademarks, copyrights, con\ufb01dential information, technical know -how, mask works, processes, plans, speci\ufb01cations, guidelines, graphics, training materials, softwa re programmes, records, drawings, instruction guides, student materials, new techniques, algorithms, concepts, and more. To be protected by MIT World Peace University, the intangible product of the intellect must have potential for industrial application o r for enhancing the S&T knowledge base. A patent can be awarded for any invention that is capable of being commercially applied. To meet the patentability standards, the invention must satisfy the criteria of novelty, utility, and non -obviousness. Addition ally, there must be an inventive step, which refers to an innovation that is not apparent to a person with ordinary skill in the relevant \ufb01eld. The invention may pertain to a new product, an improvement to an existing product, or a new process of manufacturing an existing or new product. Design protection can be obtained for any prototype that in\ufb02uences the consumer's choice by appealing to their aesthetic sense. In simpler terms, design protection can be secured for the appearance, visual features, and overall look of the article. However, design protection is not available for functional features. Patents are intended to safeguard applied and extension research, while copyright law is designed to protect pure or fundamental research.

PROCEDURE FOR IP PROTECTION All patent and copyright applications (as per profo rma MIT -WPU/IPR -01 and MIT -WPU/IPR -02, respectively) must be sent to the Convener/Dean R&D through the IPR Cell via the Dean of the School or Director of the Center, regardless of whether the inventions have resulted from in - house projects or sponsored projects. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 52 MIT-WPU C RECORD KEEPING PROCEDURES All data and details produced by a creator during the creation of intellectual property should be meticulously documented in the relevant School/Centre, with speci\ufb01c emphasis on the following: Avoid using abbreviations or technical terms that are not commonly understood, unless they are explained in a table at the beginning or end of the book. This will ensure that readers who are not familiar with the terminology can understand the text without confusion or dif\ufb01culty. Important information such as data, descriptions, or experiments that pertain to signi\ufb01cant inventions or discoveries should be attributed and documented by the individual(s) responsible for the project, such as the creator, supervisor, or coordinator. I. Any changes that need to be made should be indicated by crossing out the deleted content and labeling it as \"cancelled\". The corrected data, clearly marked as such, should be entered immediately below and authenticated by the creator with their initials an d the date. II. In cases where new products are created or produced by a new method, it is advisable to preserve samples and take photographs for record keeping purposes. All photographs should be dated and signed by the creator on the back. When Should Faculty Approach IPR Cell To Discuss a Possible Patent? MIT-WPU has established an exclusive IPR Cell to manage intellectual property rights. Faculty members who have created potential intellectual property while employed by MIT-WPU can approach the IPR Cell advisor to arrange a discussion at a mutually convenient time. It is recommended that this discussion occurs well in advance of the idea maturing into a process or product. If the invention is only in the conception stage, it is possible to \ufb01le a provisional speci\ufb01cation, which must be followed up with a complete speci\ufb01cation within 12 months; otherwise, the patent application will be considered abandoned. However, if the inventor has an innovative product that can be immediately marketed, a complete speci\ufb01cation can be lod ged right away. EVALUATION OF PATENT/COPYRIGHT APPLICATIONS The IPR Cell will receive and examine each patent/copyright application submitted through an Invention Disclosure Form/Copyright Disclosure form according to the MIT-WPU/IPR -01/MIT -WPU/IPR -02 proforma. Additionally, an IPR facilitation request (MIT -WPU/IPR -03) must be included. The committee may request assistance from other professors who are experts in the relevant \ufb01eld to conduct an initial evaluation of proposals for their potential patentability. These domain experts will be required to sign a non-Disclosure agreement according to the MIT -WPU/IPR -04 proforma and a No Con\ufb02ict -of-Interest Form according to the MIT -WPU/IPR -05 profor ma before being granted access to the proposal. If necessary, the inventors may be asked to present their case before the IPR Cell. If the Cell recommends \ufb01ling for patents, the Convener of the IPR Cell will facilitate the application through one of the a pproved attorneys from the panel maintained by the IPR Cell. ASSISTANCE IN FILLING THE PROFORMA Once the IPR Cell approves protecting the Intellectual output, a patent Attorney shall be identi\ufb01ed by the Cell for drafting the IP application. The following aspects need to receive attention: Objective of the invention: What problem is the inventor trying to solve? What are the issues involved? The objective of the invention should clearly state the problem that the inventor is trying to solve. This should be a concise statement that identi\ufb01es the issues involved in the invention. For example, the objective of the invention might be to develop a more ef\ufb01cient method for processing data or to create a new device that solves a speci\ufb01c problem in a particular industry. 53 www.mitwpu.edu.in What prior art searches have been made?

Who are responsible for administration of IPRs in the country? The Controller General of Patents, Designs, and Trademarks is responsible for overseeing patents, designs, and trademarks. This department operates under the Ministry of Industry's Department of Industrial Development. Copyright, on the other hand, falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Human Resource Development. 4. What is a patent? A patent is a legal monopoly which is granted for a limited time to the owner of an invention. Patent rights A patent is a legal right granted by the state that provides a limited -time monopoly to the owner of an invention. Simply possessing a patent does not automatically give the owner the right to use or exploit the patented invention; other laws and regulations, such as those governing health and safety, food and drugs, and inheritance, may also affect these rights. Patent rights can be sold, licensed, inherited, abandoned, and may even be subject to revocation by the state in certain circumstances, both before and aft er the grant of the patent. Additionally, there are global patents available for international protection. 55 www.mitwpu.edu.in 5. What is the distinction between patented invention and know -how? According to the law, a patent speci\ufb01cation does not have to disclose all the information required for the commercial exploitation of the invention. Therefore, the information provided in a patent speci\ufb01cation may not be suf\ufb01cient for commercialization purposes. In contrast, known -how refers to all the information necessary for commercializing an invention, such as details of production methods and design drawings needed to set up a production plant. If known -how is developed around an existing patent and subsequently commercialized without the patentee's agreement, it may be considered an infringement of the patent unless the patentee has agreed to such commercialization on mutually. Agreed terms. 6. How is an invention interpreted? For an invention to be considered patentable, it must not only be novel, but also involve an inventive step. This means that the invention must not be obvious to a person skilled in the relevant \ufb01eld, taking into consideration the state of the art, but disregarding unpublished pending patent applications. However, simplicity is not necessarily a barrier to securing a patent. The means of achieving the desired outcome may be simple and common, but an inventive step may still exist if the inventor has developed a variant that produces more useful results. It does not matter whether the invention was developed by accident, as long as it involves some level of inventive step. Whether or not it has been in the meantime sold or licensed. There is no such thing as What are patentable inventions under the patent Act, 1970? Invention means any new and useful: Art, process, method, or manner of manufacture Machines, apparatus, or another article Substances produced by manufacture and included any new and useful improvements of any of them and an alleged invention. However, inventions claiming substances intended for use; or capable of being used, as food or as medicine of drug or relating to subst ances prepared or produced by chemical processes (including alloys, optical glass, semi -conductors, and inter -metallic compounds) are not patentable. 7. How is the novelty of and invention determined? The novelty of an invention is determined based on the knowledge that is available globally, including in India, at the time of \ufb01ling the patent application. This means that the invention should not have been known or disclosed to the public anywhere in the world before the \ufb01ling date of the patent application . 8. What are the types of inventions which are not patentable? An invention which is frivolous, or which claims anything obviously contrary to well established natural laws e.g., different types of perpetual motion or machines which violate the third law of thermodynamics. An invention that has a primary or intended use which is contrary to law or morality or injurious to public health is not considered patentable. For example, a process for preparing a beverage that involves the use of a carcinogenic substance, even if the beverage has a higher nourishment value, would not be considered patentable. The mere discovery of a scienti\ufb01c principle or the form ulation of an abstract theory is not patentable. For example, the discovery of the Raman Effect, which is a scienti\ufb01c principle, cannot be patented. However, an invention that makes use of scienti\ufb01c principle or theory can be patented if it meets the criteria of novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability. To be patentable, the invention must involve an inventive step. Thus, the mere discovery of any new property or",

Thus, the mere discovery of any new property or new use of a known substance or the mere use of a known process, machine or apparatus is not considered patentable, unless such a known process results in a new product or employs at least one new reactant. In other words, there must be some degree of i nnovation and improvement in the known substance or process to be eligible for a patent. A substance that is created by simply mixing existing substances together, resulting only in the combination of their properties, is not patentable. The same applies to a process for creating such a substance. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 56 MIT-WPU C The mere arrangement, rearrangement, or duplication of features of known devices, each functioning independently of one another in a known way, is not considered an invention and hence not patentable. In other words, a patent cannot be granted for a combin ation of known features that does not result in any new or improved function or technical effect. A method or process of testing applicable during the process of manufacture for rendering the machine, apparatus, or other equipment more ef\ufb01cient. A method of agriculture or horticulture. Any process for medicinal, surgical, curative, prophylactic or other treatment of human \u2018beings, or any process for a simila r treatment of animals or plants. Invention relating to atomic energy. 9. When should an application for a patent be \ufb01led? a) It is important to \ufb01le a patent application as soon as possible, rather than waiting until the invention is fully developed for commercial use. Filing an application with a provisional speci\ufb01cation can help establish priority for the applicant. Delay in \ufb01ling an application can lead to risks such as other inventors applying for a patent for the same invention before the \ufb01rst inventor, or inadvertent publica tion of the invention by the inventor or others independently. What are the essential patent documents to be generated and submitted by a potential patentee? b) There are two types of patent documents usually known as patent speci\ufb01cation namely. Provisional speci\ufb01cation Complete speci\ufb01cation PROVISIONAL SPECIFICATION To add to the previous answer, a complete speci\ufb01cation is a detailed description of the invention and how to make and use it. It should include claims that de\ufb01ne the scope of the invention for which protection is sought. The claims must be clear, concise, and supported by the description. The complete speci\ufb01cation must be \ufb01led within 12 months from the date of \ufb01ling the provisional speci\ufb01cation, and failure to do so will result in the abandonment of the application. It's also worth noting that while a provisional speci\ufb01cation may be \ufb01led without any claims, the complete speci\ufb01cation must include at least one claim de\ufb01ning the scope of the invention. The claims must be carefully drafted to ensure that they are not overly broad or vague, which could result in the patent being challenged or invalidated later. The provisional speci\ufb01cation is not a permanent and independent scienti\ufb01c cum legal document. It is a temporary document \ufb01led to establish priority of the invention and to secure a \ufb01ling date. Amendments to the provisional speci\ufb01cation can be made at any time before \ufb01ling a complete speci\ufb01cation. However, once a complete speci\ufb01cation is \ufb01led, amendments to the provisional speci\ufb01cation are not allowed. COMPLETE SPECIFICATION To obtain a patent, it is necessary to submit a Complete Speci\ufb01cation. This speci\ufb01cation should include informa - tion about the \ufb01eld to which the invention relates, the background of the prior art, any drawbacks related to the previously known details of the invention, the best way of carrying out the invention, and claims that de\ufb01ne the scope of the invention. The Complete Speci\ufb01cation should provide enough information to enable a person skilled in the art to work on the invention without requiring assistance from the inventor. 57 www.mitwpu.edu.in 10. What are the criteria for naming inventors(s) in an application for patent? The naming of inventors is normally decided based on the following criteria: All persons who have contributed towards the conception or reduction to practice of at least one claim of the invention should be named as an inventor. Intellectual contribution towards the results of the research work leading to a patent is not suf\ufb01cient for being named as an inventor. Contribution towards the conception or reduction to practice of at least one claim of the invention is necessary. A person who has not contributed to the conception or reduction to practice of at least one claim of the invention is not entitled to be included as an inventor. A person who provides only routine assistance, such as making dr awings or constructing a prototype under the direction of an inventor, is not entitled to be named as an inventor. Dif\ufb01culties may arise in determining who should be named as an inventor, and to avoid such situations,",

Dif\ufb01culties may arise in determining who should be named as an inventor, and to avoid such situations, it is important for all researchers to maintain clear and accurate records of their work in a consecutively numbered diary, with entries signed by both the researchers and their team leader. 11. Can a published or disclosed invention be patented? To clarify, if an inventor publicly discloses their invention before \ufb01ling a patent application, it could potentially prevent them from obtaining a patent. This is because one of the requirements for obtaining a patent is that the invention must be new and non -obvious at the time the patent application is \ufb01led. If the invention has already been publi cly disclosed, it may no longer meet the novelty requirement. Therefore, it is generally recommended that inventors do not disclose their inventions publicly before \ufb01ling a patent application. Instead, they should keep their invention con\ufb01dential and \ufb01le a patent application as soon as possible. If an inventor does choose to disclose their invention before \ufb01ling a patent application, they may still be able to obtain a patent if they \ufb01le the application within a certain time frame. In the United States, for example, inventors have one year from the date of the \ufb01rst public disclosure to \ufb01le a patent application. If an inventor does obtain a patent, they should include the patent number and date in any subsequent publications or disclosures related to the invention. This provides information to the public about the existence of the patent and its scope of protection. 12. What is considered the date of patent? The date on which the complete speci\ufb01cation is \ufb01led is considered the date of patent, and it is a crucial date for determining the legal protection of the invention covered by the patent. The term of the patent is calculated from this date, and it is from this date that the exclusive rights of the patent holder begin. 13. What is the term of a patent in Indian system? The term of every patent in India is 20 years, starting from the date of \ufb01ling of the patent application, regardless of whether it was \ufb01led with a provisional or complete speci\ufb01cation. However, for applications \ufb01led under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), the term of 20 years begins from the international \ufb01ling date. 14. How does one keep a patent in force for the full patent terms? To maintain a patent's validity, the patent holder is required to pay renewal fees at regular intervals. If the renewal fees are not paid, the patent will expire and will no longer be legally enforceable. Once a patent has expired, the invention becomes open to the public, and anyone can use, manufacture or sell the invention without permission from the original patent holder. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 58 MIT-WPU C 15. What is expected from a patentee? As per Indian patent law, it is expected that a patent holder should work their invention in India on a commercial scale and without any unnecessary delay. A patent is not granted simply to provide a monopoly to the patent holder for importing the patented product into India. This means that a patent holder ca nnot simply hold onto their invention and prevent others from using it. The intention behind granting a patent is to promote innovation and encourage the progress of technology, and to ensure that the invention is being utilized for the bene\ufb01t of society. 16. What is the nature of the information needed while consulting a patent attorney? When working with a patent agent or attorney to \ufb01le a patent application, it is important to provide them with a clear and comprehensive explanation of the invention. This may include information about the history of the invention, including where the idea came from and how it was developed. Any early failures or prototypes may also be relevant to understanding the inventive step involved in the invention. It is important to highlight what you believe to be the most central and inventive aspect of the invention, as well as any similar prior inventions that may exist. If you have developed an improved version of a competitor's product, it is important to disclose this information to the patent agent. Honesty and transparency in these matters will help the patent agent to draft claims and speci \ufb01cations that accurately re\ufb02ect the invention and avoid any potential for excessive claims that could be rejected. By providing your patent agent with a comprehensive understanding of your invention, including its history, inventive elements, and any prio r inventions or improvements, they will be better equipped to draft a strong patent application that maximizes the protection of your invention. In order to \ufb01le a strong patent application, it is important to provide a detailed description of how the inve ntion can be practically used, as well as any test results or trials conducted",

This includes any failures or defects encountered during testing, as well as any alternative ways of using the invention or potential substitutes for its parts. It may be worthwhile to draft the patent application in such a way that it covers a broad range of alternatives, including less satisfactory options, to prevent competitors from marketing subpar products that could tarnish the reputation of the entire product genre. During the patent application process, it is import ant to respond quickly and accurately to any queries from the patent agent. This will help to keep the application on track and save time and money. As the inventor, it is also important to keep the patent agent informed of any new developments or improvem ents made to the invention, as well as any new competitors that may arise. This will help the patent agent to draft a strong and effective patent application that accurately re\ufb02ects the invention and provides maximum protection. 59 www.mitwpu.edu.in 17.

To communicate the sound recording to the public Explanation: For the purpose of this section, a copy which has been sold once shall be deemed to be a copy already in circulation. 19. How is a computer de\ufb01ned for the purpose of copyright? Computers include any electronic or similar device having information processing capabilities. 20. What is the de\ufb01nition of a computer programme? A computer programme refers to a sequence of instructions, expressed in various forms such as words, codes, schemes or other formats, that enables a computer to perform a speci\ufb01c task or achieve a particular result. This sequence of instructions may be stored on a machine -readable medium, such as a hard drive, USB drive or other similar storage device, and can be executed by a computer processor to perform various functions or tasks. In essence, a computer programme is a collection of instructions that a computer can follow to perform a speci\ufb01c task or series of tasks. 21. What is the term of a copyright? The term of copyright protection for a literary work published during the author's lifetime is the life of the author plus 60 years. This means that the copyright protection lasts for the entire lifetime of the author and for 60 years after their death. The term of copyright protection for cinematographic \ufb01lms, records, photographs, posthumous publications, anonymous publications, works of government, and international agencies is 60 years from the beginning of the calendar year following the year in which the work was published. This means that copyright protection lasts for 60 years from the year after the publication year. The term of copyright protection for broadcasting is 25 years from the beginning of the calendar year following the year in which the broadcast was made. This means that copyright protection lasts for 25 years from the year after the year in which the broadcast was made. 61 www.mitwpu.edu.in IPR POLICY IPR is a general term covering patents, registered design, trademarks, copyright, and layout design of integrated circuits, trade secrets, geographical indicators, and anti-competitive practices in contractual licenses. The Intellectual Property could be protected in the form of: Patent (to be registered) , Design Registrations (to be registered) , Trademark (registered or otherwise) , Copyright refers to the legal protection granted to the creators of original works of authorship, such as literary, artistic, and musical works, in various forms including registered or unregistered. In the context of the Institute, it may include plans, speci\ufb01cations, guidelines, graphics, training materials, software programmes, records, drawings, instruction guides, student materials, new techniques, algorithms, concepts, and other forms of creative expression. Con\ufb01dential information and technical know -how may also be protected under copy right law if they are embodied in original works of authorship. Mask works, which are designs used to create semiconductor chips, may also be protected under copyright law. Additionally, copyright protection may extend to the processes used to create works of authorship, such as the techniques used to produce a particular type of artwork or the algorithms used to generate computer programmes. Intellectual Property (IP) refers to intangible creations of the mind, such as inventions, ideas, designs, software programmes, and other forms of knowledge. It includes all results, conclusions, deductions, improvements, discoveries, solutions, processes, modi\ufb01cations, data, and information generated or produced by the faculty, staff, students, research scholars, and other employees of the Institute. IP is the result of research activities supported or sponsored by the Institute, industrial consulting, or other forms of joint research and development work. The ownership of IP resulting from such activities is determined by the Institute's IP policy. A patent application accompanied by a provisional application does not provide legal rights to the applicants. However, it is a crucial document that establishes the earliest ownership of an invention. This can be important in cases where multiple parties claim ownership of an invention. The provisional application establishes the priority date of the invention, which can be crucial in determining who has the right to \ufb01le a patent application \ufb01rst. SALIENT FEATURES OF IPR AND SERVICES PROVIDED BY IPR CELL RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 MIT-WPU C EXCEPTIONS FOR PATENT: To clarify, inventions that claim substances that are intended for use as food, medicine, or drugs, or that are capable of being used as such, are not patentable. Similarly, inventions that relate to substances that are prepared or produced by chemical processes, including alloys, optical glass, semi -conductors, and inter -metallic compounds, are also not patentable. WHETHER PATENT CAN BE REVOKED: Since a patent is granted by the state, it can also be revoked by the state under certain circumstances, even after it has been granted. It's important to note that a patent can be revoked by the state regardless of whether it has been sold or licensed in the meantime. CONTEST/CONFLICT WITH SPONSORING AGENCY: If the sponsoring agency does not cooperate in \ufb01ling a joint intellectual property rights (IPR) application, the Institute may choose to \ufb01le the application on its own with complete ownership and will bear all costs associated with securing and protecting the IPR. Copyright law protects pure or basic research, whereas patents seek to protect applied and extended research. If the intellectual property results from joint research carried out by Institute personnel and external organizations/ agencies/individuals, the ownership of the IP will be shared jointly by the Institute and the collaborators. In such cases, the Institut e will have the \ufb01rst right to commercially exploit the joint IP, regardless of whether it has been formally protected by patent(s) or not. IP COUNSELLING: The IPR cell will provide guidance and support to potential inventors of intellectual products and will assist the Institute in identifying the potential for IPR. If the cell recommends \ufb01ling for patents, the Convener/Dean R&D through the IPR cell will process the application through an approved attorney from the panel maintained by the IPR cell.

If any copyrightable work is created during sponsored or collaborative activities, ownership of the copyright will be determined by the terms and conditions outlined in the relevant contract or through mutual agreement with the sponsoring/collaborating agency. All faculty members, staff, students, research scholars (internal and external), visiting scientists, professors, and other professionals, whether full-time or part -time, can avail themselves of the services provided by the IPR cell. MIT -WPU has established sy stems and mechanisms to facilitate the commercial exploitation of the knowledge generated at the Institute under the provisions of the IPR regime in the country. SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE IPR CELL: It is crucial to respond promptly and accurately to queries from the patent agent both during the initial search and throughout the patent application process. This will facilitate the progress of the patent application and potentially save money. The IPR cell will periodically suggest patentable technologi es to potential licensing agencies, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), and other \ufb01nancial institutions, encouraging them to invest in venture capital for new technologies. 63 www.mitwpu.edu.in Is it possible to utilize the services of MIT -WPU IPR Cell to apply for a patent and get it granted? Certainly, I understand. The IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) Cell at MIT -WPU is responsible for assisting faculty members, research associates, research scholars, students, and other researchers working at MIT -WPU in obtaining patents for their inventio ns. In what proportion would the expenditure to be incurred for getting the patent granted be shared between MIT -WPU and the inventors? To clarify, if an inventor processes their patent application through MIT-WPU IPR Cell and MIT-WPU is designated as the assignee for the granted patent, then MIT-WPU is responsible for paying the fees associated with the various stages of the patent application process. In this case, the inventor is not required to pay any fees. If the expenditure to be incurred for the patenting process is fully borne by MIT-WPU, what will be royalty share for inventors after the patent is granted and we go for commercialization? As MIT-WPU is the sole applicant, there is no revenue sharing model, even for commercialized patents. Can you help us with the complete rules and regulations of the patent application and regulations followed by the MIT -WPU IPR Cell? Please go through the links \u2018frequently asked questions\u2019 and \u2018IPR Policy\u2019 under \u201cIPR Cell\u201d link at MIT-WPU Website. Is it possible to apply for a patent as an individual without help from MIT -WPU? To put it another way, if the invention is the result of work conducted by a researcher during their time at MIT-WPU and if the facilities provided by MIT -WPU were utilized in the creation of the invention, then it is expected that the inventor will \ufb01le their patent application through the MIT -WPU IPR Cell and designate MIT -WPU as the assignee. If the patent application is not processed through MIT -WPU IPR Cell, will MIT -WPU still \ufb01nancially support the patenting process? To rephrase, if the inventor chooses not to apply for a patent through the MIT-WPU IPR Cell, then MIT-WPU will not assume any responsibility for the costs associated with the patenting process. What is the documentation to be submitted to IPR Cell and what is the mode of submission, when one makes a beginning with patenting his invention? The Inventor is required to submit their proposal in the format of an Invention Disclosure Form (IDF) when making their proposal. It's important to note that the format of the IDF differs depending on whether it is for a patent or a design registration. The blank IDF for patent or design registration can be downloaded from the IPR Cell link on the MIT -WPU website. It's worth noting that there have been instances where Inventors have submitted Forms 1, 2, 3, and 5 of the Indian Patents Act 1970 as part of their proposal. However, it's important to remember that these forms are not required to be submitted to the IPR Cell. Instead, only the IDF is necessary for submitting the proposal. If the proposal is for a design registration, the Inventors must enter into an \"Agreement on Designs\" with MIT -WPU on a non -judicial stamp paper worth Rs. 20. A template for the agreement can be downloaded from the IPR Cell link on the MIT -WPU website. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ) RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 MIT-WPU C Which are the points which need particular attention, while \ufb01lling in the Invention Disclosure Form (IDF) for patents? The following points in IDF require particular attention: Point 8: General area of the patent: Please be speci\ufb01c.

The policy encompasses all forms of research that involve human participants, their tissues, or data, and should also be applied more broadly to activities such as enterprise and innovation, or service evaluation and audit, where ethical issues may arise. These policies are applicable to all research conducted by MIT-WPU's faculty and students. For studies that have obtained external ethical approval, there is no need to repeat the process. The appropriate University Ethics Committee must be informed and provided with a copy of the approval. The Ethics Committee will con\ufb01rm that no additional approval is necessary for the study. This policy is applicable to all individuals conducting research either within the University or on behalf of it. This includes staff, individuals with honorary University appointments, visiting researchers, undergraduate and postgraduate students, as well as visiting scholars and students. When a research project is being carried out by academics from multiple institutions, the lead institution (usually the institution where the Principal Investigator is employed) should seek the relevant ethical clearance for the project, and other partner institutions should be informed of any outcomes and issues. PURPOSE The aim of this policy and procedure is to establish and promote the highest ethical standards in academic research. The University is dedicated to safeguarding the rights, dignity, safety, and privacy of research subjects, as well as the well -being of animals, and ensuring environmental protection. Additionally, the University is committed to minimizing health and safety risks for researchers and upholding their academic freedom. The Institutional Ethics Committee of MIT-WPU will evaluate and approve all research proposals involving human participants, taking into account the welfare and safety of actual and potential research participants. The goals of research, no matter how important, should never be prioritized over the health and well -being of the research subjects. GUIDELINES Researchers af\ufb01liated with MIT-WPU must seek approval from the Ethics Committee. The ethical review process should ensure adherence to the following policy documents of MIT-WPU. a. Policy for Promotion of Research b. Plagiarism Policy c. Patent Policy d. Consultancy Policy ETHICS COMMITTEE 77 www.mitwpu.edu.in The University mandates an ethical review of all research projects that involve primary research with human subjects (or their data), regardless of funding source. In most cases, a review would be conducted by a Research Ethics Committee. Projects involving living persons, human tissues, or data related to recently deceased persons, as well as projects involving animals (including animals living in their natural habitats), must have genuine research, educational, or training purpose. Ethical approval is required for all research involving human participants, human material, or human data. Howe ver, research that uses information about human participants that is publicly and lawfully available, such as census data, population statistics, court reports, and personal letters or diaries in public libraries, is exempt from this requirement. The University has a Code of Ethics for Research that includes funda mental principles to protect human participants. The University requires that all research falling under this policy must adhere to the Code of Ethics and its fundamental principles. The University's policies,",

Projects involving living persons, human tissues, or data related to recently deceased persons, as well as projects involving animals (including animals living in their natural habitats), must have genuine research, educational, or training purpose. Ethical approval is required for all research involving human participants, human material, or human data. Howe ver, research that uses information about human participants that is publicly and lawfully available, such as census data, population statistics, court reports, and personal letters or diaries in public libraries, is exempt from this requirement. The University has a Code of Ethics for Research that includes funda mental principles to protect human participants. The University requires that all research falling under this policy must adhere to the Code of Ethics and its fundamental principles. The University's policies, committees, and sub -committees must consider the relevant professional ethical codes and research sponsor policies. If there is a difference in ethical standards between the University policy and the relevant professional body or research sponsor, the committees should apply the highest standard of ethical practice. Research ethics committees should be appropriate to the disciplinary mix of research they will review, comply with speci\ufb01c funding or professional body requirements, and comply with relevant legislative requirements. They should also consider the anticipated volume of work. Every research ethics committee should not only take the responsibility of reviewing and approving all research within its jurisdiction but also create and endorse research ethics toolkits. These toolkits should include standard consent forms, participant information sheets, and protocols for ensuring security, con\ufb01dentiality, anonymization, and retention o f data. It is essential for all research ethics committees to maintain detailed records of their proceedings and decisions. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 MIT-WPU C APPLICATION AND APPEALS PROCEDURE APPLICATIONS FOR ETHICAL APPROVAL The Institutional Research Ethics Board ethical committee will consider the following matters when reviewing applications for ethical approval, considering their relevance to the research project: The risk of physical, emotional, or reputational harm to research participants, and the steps that will be taken to minimize or mitigate these risks. The risk of physical or emotional harm to the researcher, and the steps that will be taken to minimize or mitigate these risks. The procedures for recruiting research participants and obtaining their informed consent, including the provision of participant information sheets and consent forms. The rationale for using observation or covert surveillance, or any other methods that may not be transparent to research participants. The measures that will be taken to ensure the security and con\ufb01dentiality of personal data and any human tissues or artefacts collected for the project, particularly those that will be stored or processed off-site. The arrangements for the retention, anonymization, and disposal of personal data, artefacts, or tissues at the end of the project, or as required by research sponsors or legal provisions. The procedures for debrie\ufb01ng research participants, particularly in cases where the research may have caused them distress. The procedures for reporting and dealing with any adverse reactions to the research project. The measures that will be taken to ensure that appropriate Ethical Board checks are conducted when researchers are working in settings where children or vulnerable adults may be present. If ethical approval is not granted or if signi\ufb01cant modi\ufb01cations are required for the proposed research, the Institutional Research Ethics Board must provide detailed written feedback to the applicant. In the case of research students, the feedback must also be provided to their Director of Studies or Lead Supervisor, as appropriate. If the issue cannot be resolved informally, applicants have the right to appeal. APPEALS If there are statutory requirements that specify different procedures for appeals, these will take precedence over the appeals procedures outlined in this Policy. Researchers who are bound by their own professional code of conduct should be aware that their own ethics policies may be more rigorous than those outlined in this Policy, and they must comply with their professional codes. Failure to comply with ethics approval may be deemed as serious professional misconduct, which the university is obligated to report to the researcher's professional body. 79 www.mitwpu.edu.in INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH ETHICS BOARD The university shall establish an Institutional Research Ethics Board to ensure that research activities conducted by researchers are fully compliant with the university's regulations on research ethics and the protectio n of human and non- human subjects involved in research.

The university has an obligation to safeguard public funds and ensure that it delivers the assured value for mo ney to its students and other beneficiaries. The Tuition Fee Policy forms part of the university\u2019s Terms and Conditions and should be read in conjunction with them, for together they provide the comprehensive framework for the setting, payment, collection, and reconciliation of tuition fees. Course fees include all compulsory elements needed for students to meet the minimum learning outcomes of the course. In some courses, optional additional costs may be incurred. The purpose of this policy is to set out the tuition fee liability that applies to students upon enrolment on a course/programme of study. Scope This policy relates to: \u27a2 Student tuition fee liability This policy does not relate to: \u27a2 Non-refundable tuition fee deposits \u27a2 Accommodation fees 37 | P a g e Policy \u27a2 All students bear a personal liability for the tuition fee associated with any course/programme of study for which they enrol. \u27a2 All students must enrol for each successive year or another relevant part of their course/courses at MIT World Peace University no later than 30 days after the stating date of the respective course/courses). o Upon non -completion of enrolment by/before the prescribed deadline dates, students will be withdrawn from their ongoing course. Once withdrawn, the students\u2019 ID card will be deactivated following which they will not be able to attend lectures, use the libr ary, submit, or sit for assessments or take part in any other academic activity. \u27a2 The University has a ' fixed fee ' policy for tuition fee meaning that the fee charged at the beginning of the programme remains the same throughout that particular programme. \u27a2 The ' fixed fee ' policy will apply even if a student interrupts or repeats another year of study. \u27a2 It is the students\u2019 responsibility to ensure that they will be able to pay for their entire course duration prior to enrolment. \u27a2 Enrolment will not be permitted unless any/all outstanding debt(s) from the previous year has been paid in full or an instalment plan has been agreed upon by the university\u2019s Fee Team. \u27a2 IMPORTANT: Students are legally responsible for payment of their complete tuition fee themselves, whether they have an SLC loan or a sponsor. If the sponsor does not pay the university, or if the students find out that they are not eligible for a SLC loan, or they lose 38 | P a g e their eligibility for an SLC loan at any time after the commencement of the course, the students will be liable to pay their own fees for any/all periods of study that is not paid for by a sponsor or the SLC. This applies to all forms of undergraduate and postgraduate fee. \u27a2 Students who are considering discontinuing their programme of study are encouraged to first consult with the University for Advice and Guidance before making the final decision to leave. Further information on the range of support available can be found on the university website. \u27a2 In all cases, wherein a student withdraws from or discontinues their studies, or is granted a period of leave of absence from their studies, the date of withdrawal/discontinuation/leave of absence is accounted for by the university towards calculating the cumulative tuition fee liability. \u27a2 For students who are sponsored, in the event of the sponsor not making payment in respect of the tuition fees, the student will be personally liable for the payment. \u27a2 Students funded by the Student Loans Company (SLC) will be liable for payment of either 50% or 100% of the tuition fee loan, in line with SLC policy in case of discontinuation mid - programme. For undergraduate students starting in August, the liability will stand at 50% in case the withdrawal takes place before course commencement & remaining 50% will be liable after completion of 90 days from the course commencement date. \u27a2 The university reserves the right to take appropriate action against students who fail to pay their fees, or make satisfactory arrangements to pay on, or by the end of a set period after the starting date of their course. When to pay fees: Students either can make the full payment or can opt for the payment in instalments as per the fee payment schedule declared and published by the university. First Installment Fee will have to be paid in full for the seat to be confirmed in candidate \u2019s name (no parti al payments are permitted) . How to pay fees: 39 | P a g e The University is committed to offering a simplified payment experience, which is both secure and safe.

Awards Funding Amount: 25K to 3L Duration of Project: 6 months to 3 years (Progress evaluation after every 6 months) Selection Criteria The R&D Cell will issue a call for proposals once a year, and individual faculty or a group of faculties along with the student members can submit their applications. An innovation screening committee will be established to review the proposals according to a prede\ufb01ned process, and the committee will make recommendations or non-recommendations for individual projects. The endorsement of an innovation project will depend on the innovation funds resulting in a solution for current technical and social challenges that eventually leads to the generation of intellectual property that can be marketed and has potent ial for commercial success through technology transfer. Teams of students are also eligible to apply for innovation funds. The teams will be required to present their ideas before a panel of experts and industry sponsors, following a \u2018Shark Tank\u2019 model.

Alongside its undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, MIT -WPU also encourages its faculty members and academic staff to undertake consultancy projects with industry and other institutions. This not only expands and strengthens the research pro\ufb01le of MIT-WPU but also creates new knowledge and broadens the experience of faculty and staff members. This document provid es a formal framework to guide the implementation of this process. AIM OF THE DOCUMENT MIT-WPU aims to be a university that fosters innovation and is committed to adopting best practices in its engagement with external organizations. The university rec ognizes that consultancy work and external activity undertaken by its staff are crucial and valuable aspects of its operations. MIT-WPU believes that such activities are essential for knowledge exchange and can result in mutually bene\ufb01cial outcomes for both, the university and external organizations. To support its staff in the delivery of approved consultancy work, MIT -WPU has established a policy that outlines the procedures and guidelines to be followed. This policy is a part of the university's human resources management procedures and forms a part of the contract of employment for the academic staff. PURPOSE The objective of this policy is to establish the rules and regulations that govern consultancy and other external service s provided by the staff of MIT -WPU. MIT-WPU acknowledges the signi\ufb01cance of its staff engaging in consultancy for external organizations, particularly for the industry. MIT -WPU recognizes this as a vital medium through which knowledge and expertise can be shared with and from businesses and other external agencies, thereby promoting the development of mutually bene\ufb01cial relationships with these organizations. Thus, MIT -WPU promotes and supports its staff members to under take consultancy and similar work, as long as it does not contradict the interests of MIT -WPU. It is expected by MIT -WPU that external consultancy engagement will be undertaken with the highest levels of professionalism and integrity by staff members. MIT-WPU expects that the consultancy work will contribute to the development of mutually bene\ufb01cial relationships with external organizations, including industry bodies, and that it will further enhance the knowledge and expertise of staff members, thus supporting the overall development of MIT-WPU. The policy aims to provide guidance and support to staf f members in undertaking consultancy work in a way that is consistent with the interests of MIT-WPU and ensures transparency, ethical practice, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations. Benefits of engagement: External consultancy provides an opportunity for the staff members to increase their professional and/or academic competence and experience, and a chance for continuing professional education by working with industry. Engaging in external consultancy can help to create and su stain relationships between MIT -WPU and external organizations, leading to bene\ufb01ts such as increased research opportunities, student admission and placement, and ultimately contributing to knowledge exchange for the bene\ufb01t of the country. External consultancy can also generate additional income for the staff members and increased funding for MIT-WPU. MIT-WPU CONSULTANCY POLICY RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 24 www.mitwpu.edu.in APPLICABILITY MIT-WPU aims to promote and support consultancy work among its staff members in accordance with the University's employment policies and regulations. Academic staff are encouraged to engage in consultancy work that aligns with their respective disciplines and does not hinder their primary role within their department. This policy is applicable to all academic, academic -related, and administrative staff members of MIT-WPU and is to be adhered to in uniformity. DEFINITIONS \"MIT -WPU\" refers to MIT World Peace University, Pune, and may also include any subsidiary or af\ufb01liated entities authorized to conduct consultancy activities. \"Consultant\" refers to full-time faculty members of departments, core research scientists of schools/departments/ centers, and all other employees of MIT-WPU. \"Consultancy\" is de\ufb01ned as the provision of professional advice, analysis, and interpretation that draws upon and applies the expertise and knowledge of MIT -WPU staff. This work is undertaken for external clients, usually for payment. Consultancy may also include teaching commitments undertaken outside of MIT-WPU. Consultancy can be either MIT-WPU consultancy or personal consultancy, as de\ufb01ned by this policy. The essential features of consultancy include: I. The primary goal of consultancy is not the creation of new knowledge. II. Consultancy involves producing a speci\ufb01c output that may be owned by the client. III.

If issues are problematic, approval of the Pro-Vice Chancellor/Vice Chancellor shall be sought before \ufb01nal sign -off. If a client insists on an agreement on their terms, R&D will review the Client's terms and conditions, in consultation with the Legal Department of MIT-WPU, for acceptance or renegotiation. Any agreement outside of the approved standard terms and conditions can only be entered into after approval from MIT-WPU's management and shall be done by R&D. EARNINGS DISTRIBUTION MODEL The distribution model is based on income per consultancy agreement per \ufb01nancial year. Sr. No. Earnings PI & Team** MIT-WPU 1 Intellectual Consultancy 80% 20% 2 MIT-WPU Consultancy 70% 30% 3 Testing and Evaluation 60% 40% 4 Standardization and Calibration 60% 40% **The applicable income tax and other statutory taxes will be deducted from the staff's payment, and they will receive only the net amount after deductions. The payment cannot be given in cash or any other form for personal bene\ufb01t and will be paid only ele ctronically into the individual's salary bank account. The share mentioned is in addition to the individual's regular salary. Each Consultancy Agreement contract will have a unique price that will be determined on a case -by-case basis, taking into consideration the client and the nature of the project. The maximum consultancy income permissible for a staff member under the standard distribution model shall not exceed their total salary for the year, which includes basic pay and standard allowances like dearness allowance but does not include other payments such as ex-gratia, monetary or non-monetary awards. This limit applies in any \ufb01nancial year, and any amount exceeding this limit shall be deposited into MIT -WPU's Research Fund. The creation of teaching and academic materials as well as other publications such as books and articles in a consultancy project will be subject to MIT-WPU's Policy on Intellectual Property. 29 MIT-WPU C CLARIFICATIONS For all matters not covered in this document, as a general principle, Dean R&D / Director R&D may be approached for clari\ufb01cations required, if any. GENERAL All payments made for consultancy services must be processed through MIT -WPU's designated bank a ccount. This means that payments should be made in the name of MIT -WPU and not directly to individual faculty members. MIT-WPU will ensure compliance with statutory laws and distribute the appropriate share to the faculty/staff involved in the consultancy project. The client shall not be provided with a detailed breakdown of the consultancy charges, and only a lump sum \ufb01gure of the total consultancy charges may be quoted. Nevertheless, the working sheet must be kept as part of the internal records and may be subject to an internal audit as deemed necessary. The consultancy agreement must comply with the laws of India as per t he Standardized Terms and Conditions. However, in exceptional circumstances and with proper approvals, compliance with both local and international laws may be considered. The Principal Investigator (PI) is solely responsible for completing the project and delivering the agreed -upon deliverables. MIT-WPU only provides necessary support to the PI. After the completion of the project, the Principal Investigator (PI) shall provide a Final Project Completion Report (PCR) to the funding agency. Additionally, two copies of the report shall be submitted to the R&D Cell for record keeping. To ensure the project account can be closed by the Finance Department of MIT-WPU, it is important to obtain a Completion Certi\ufb01cate (CC) from the funding agency to con\ufb01rm the successful completion of the project. Testing and evaluation services can be provided to ful\ufb01ll the requirements of governmental and associated organizations, speci\ufb01c clients, and external educational institutions. MIT-WPU may provide Standardization and Calibration services in areas where the necessary facilities are available or can be expanded. It is recommended that these services be supported by regular calibration and standardization of the laboratory equipment used for these purposes. For signi\ufb01cant projects where the consultancy value exceeds Rs. 5 Lakhs (Rupees Five Lakhs only), payments may be accepted against agreed -upon milestones with appropriate prior approvals. However, for smaller projects or daily consultancy work, payments must be obtained in advance from the client(s). In exceptional situations where the assigned PI is unable to complete the consultancy work undertaken by MIT-WPU, MIT-WPU retains the authority to reassign the consultancy to another investigator. If completing the consultancy is deemed impossible or unfeasible by MIT-WPU, the Approver will address the matter with the client to close the project.

The project account will be handled by the faculty or principal investigator (PI), who will spend the funds as required. The institute's share should also be transferred. The requirement for a consultancy project/task/work can originate from the industry or other organizations concerned, or the faculty can approach the industry or other organizations. The faculty is expected to estimate the time and cost required to accompl ish the task. A proposal is then prepared by the principal investigator (PI). The budget for the proposal should be in one part and re\ufb02ect the project consultancy fee for the principal investigator (PI), co -PI, and other investigators, 50% overheads to MIT -WPU, and service tax on the total amount if applicable. Service tax is subject to periodic revision by the Government of India. Service tax is not applicable on projects if the funds are received in foreign currency. Expenses for equipment, supporting manpower, travel, and contingency must also be included in the budget, if necessary.

TESTING PROJECTS Testing refers to the process of assessing a component or product against established standards. This may include testing the strength of concrete in construction, soil compaction strength, pressure gauge calibration, and chemical identi\ufb01cation, drug ident i\ufb01cation, estimation, and evaluation of unknown species. MIT-WPU will undertake testing jobs if facilities are available, and if such testing does not interfere with any teaching or research work. Faculty may initiate testing jobs once a request is receive d. The overall procedure for operation of the testing project is similar to that of a consultancy project. GENERAL GUIDELINES Limitations: Involving Foreign Collaborators: Publications of Results: Performing regular testing tasks should be discouraged. Additionally, it is important to exercise caution and ensure that consultancy projects do not hinder the regular duties of faculty members. The proposals that involve foreign collaborators must comply with the National Laws, Rules, Regulations, and procedures in effect regarding funding support to each partner. Researchers who wish to publish technical or scienti\ufb01c papers based on the project 's research work should follow the sponsoring agency's guidelines and acknowledge the agency's assistance in the publications. If the research results are to be legally protected, the investigators should take necessary steps to secure legal protection for the research results before publishing them. External Consultants External consultants may be engaged to provide comprehensive services to clients, but their in Consul tancy Projects: Con\ufb02ict of Interest: Consultants: Exceptions: utilization will be limited. They will be entitled to receive a lump sum honorarium or fee, which should not exceed 30% of the total consultancy fee speci\ufb01ed in the Consultancy Projects Proposal. Consultants are required to disclose in writing to the Dean R&D any relationship they may have with the client funding the consultancy project or any vendor to whom payments are made from project funds, such as the involvement of immediate relatives, or any potential scope for dispro - portionate self -gain. A commi ttee will review such cases and advise the Dean R&D to ensure that there is no actual con\ufb02ict of interest, and that the consultant's involvement does not compromise their objectivity, integrity, or commitment to the Institute and the profession. Consultants are prohibited from using the name of the Institute or their af\ufb01liation with the Institute in a way that (i) implies that the Institute endorses or opposes a product or service provided by a pro\ufb01t, non- pro\ufb01t, or government entity, (ii) suggests that the Institute has conducted research or released research \ufb01ndings when it has not done so, or presents the results of Institute research in a misleading manner, or (iii) could be perceived as conveying the of\ufb01cial position of the Institute on any matter of public interest. Book royalty and honorarium for services like Expert Committee meetings, invited lectures, Ph.D. viva/evaluation, invited training programmes, organization of conferences/workshops are not considered part of the consultancy services. 43 C MIT-WPU RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 44 www.mitwpu.edu.in PREAMBLE MIT World Peace University, hereafter referred to as MIT-WPU/Institute, has been striving for the last 40 years to develop a pool of high -quality scienti\ufb01c and technical professionals and provide solutions to various challenging technological issues that may arise in different \ufb01elds. The Institute is supported by well - quali\ufb01ed faculty and highly skilled staff, committed to be coming a premier center of teaching, research, and extension in Engineering and Technology. The Institute fosters academic excellence, innovation, and encourages scholarship and research. The MIT World Peace University recognizes the value of intangible assets such as inventions, copyrights, know -how, designs, and other creative and innovative products resulting from the intellectual and scienti\ufb01c endeavors of its faculty and students, whic h provide a competitive advantage to the Institute. To provide guidance on the practices and rules regarding intellectual property rights (IPR), ownership, commercial exploitation, technology transfer, and con\ufb01dentiality requirements, the Institute has for mulated its intellectual property policy. The policy aims to create an environment conducive to curiosity -driven and market -driven research and development activities, as well as the creation of original works of authorship, for the bene\ufb01t of the Institute, its faculty, staff, students, research scholars, and external agencies. It should be emphasized that this IPR policy should be considered as a guide rather than a rigid regulation in the legal sense, given the constantly evolving landscape of the national IPR policy, and may be subject to modi\ufb01cations if necessary. This document, along with the accompanying addendum (Operating guidelines) and annexures (providing useful information on Patents and Copyright), is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the Intellectual Property (IP) management framework at MIT -WPU. PURPOSE The purpose of the IPR policy of MIT-WPU is to: The primary objective of MIT -WPU's intellectual property policy is to facilitate, encourage, promote and",

To provide guidance on the practices and rules regarding intellectual property rights (IPR), ownership, commercial exploitation, technology transfer, and con\ufb01dentiality requirements, the Institute has for mulated its intellectual property policy. The policy aims to create an environment conducive to curiosity -driven and market -driven research and development activities, as well as the creation of original works of authorship, for the bene\ufb01t of the Institute, its faculty, staff, students, research scholars, and external agencies. It should be emphasized that this IPR policy should be considered as a guide rather than a rigid regulation in the legal sense, given the constantly evolving landscape of the national IPR policy, and may be subject to modi\ufb01cations if necessary. This document, along with the accompanying addendum (Operating guidelines) and annexures (providing useful information on Patents and Copyright), is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the Intellectual Property (IP) management framework at MIT -WPU. PURPOSE The purpose of the IPR policy of MIT-WPU is to: The primary objective of MIT -WPU's intellectual property policy is to facilitate, encourage, promote and safeguard scienti\ufb01c inquiry, research pursuits and academic freedom of its faculty, researchers and students. The Institute aims to foster a culture of innovation that encourages the creation and development of intellectual property within its premises.; The policy aims to provide a clear understanding of the rights and responsibilities of the faculty, staff, and students regarding intellectual property and to protect the interests of the Institute and its members. One of the objectives of the MIT-WPU IPR policy is to establish a comprehensive management policy and procedural guidelines for converting the knowledge generated within the Institute to wealth. This involves the identi\ufb01cation, protection, management, and commercialization of intellectual property assets, such as patents, copyrights, and trademar ks, with the aim of generating income for the Institute and its members. The policy also includes guidelines for technology transfer, licensing agreements, and spin -off companies, as well as procedures for resolving disputes related to IPR. The primary objective of the IPR policy is to enable the Institute to make effective and bene\ufb01cial use of the intellectual property created by its members, in order to maximize the bene\ufb01ts to the inventors, the Institute, and the society as a whole. The aim is to establish the Institute as a leading academic research center that upholds the highest standards of scholarship and teaching. This can be achieved by disseminating the bene\ufb01ts of intellectual property generated at the Institute to the communi ty and society. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (POLICY AND GUIDELINES) OBJECTIVES The IPR policy of the Institute aims to: The Institute aims to protect and enhance the value of intellectual property created by its faculty, staff, and students during their tenure at the Institute. This will provide opportunities for wealth generation, alleviation of human suffering, and improvement of human life. The objective is to promote awareness and culture of IPR among the faculty, staff, and students of the Institute by implementing prudent IP management practices. Establish a centralized and comprehensive reference system to address all IPR related issues in a streamlined and ef\ufb01cient manner, making it easier for faculty, staff, and students to access infor mation and receive guidance. The IPR policy of the Institute aims to proactively create an environment that fosters the generation of new knowledge through research and innovations, while also aligning with the educational mission of the Institute. SCOPE This policy applies to all forms of intellectual property resulting from the intellectual and scienti\ufb01c pursuits of the following individuals: faculty members, staff, students, research scholars (both internal and external), individuals employed in sponsored research and consultancy projects, visiting scientists/professors/professionals who contribute to the teaching and research wor k conducted at the Institute, whether full -time or part -time, regardless of whether these rights are eligible for registration. The intellectual property generated from academic research encompasses patents, designs, copyright, know -how, and con\ufb01dential in formation. POLICY STATEMENT The Institute is dedicated to balancing the promotion, protection, management, and commercialization of intellectual property while also maintaining its core values of teaching, research, and community service. It acknowledg es the importance of commercializing and exploiting intellectual property for generating additional revenue for the Institute and offering bene\ufb01ts to its staff and students. However, the Institute also acknowledges the signi\ufb01cance of traditional academic v alues and expectations. DEFINITIONS Intellectual Property (IP) refers to intangible knowledge products and encompasses all types of results, conclusions, deductions, inventions, ideas, improvements, discoveries, enhancements, solutions, processes, modi\ufb01cations, know -how, data, and informatio n that are conceived, generated, made, or reduced to practice by the faculty, staff, students, research scholars, and other employees of the Institute. This includes designs, software programmes, genetically engineered microorganisms, business models, and copyrightable works that result from their intellectual output. IP is the result of research supported or sponsored by the Institute, industrial consulting, or other collaborative research and development efforts. Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) refers to the legal rights that are granted to individuals or entities for their creative and innovative works. These rights are derived from various forms of intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. IPR grants exclusive rights to the creators or owners of intellectual property, allowing them to contr ol the use, distribution, and commercialization of their creations. This ensures that they are able to bene\ufb01t \ufb01nancially from their work and encourages further innovation and creativity. Some examples of IPR include the following: Patents: These are legal protections granted to inventors for their new and useful inventions or discoveries. They give the inventor the exclusive right to manufacture, use, and sell the invention for a certain period. 45 C MIT-WPU RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 46 www.mitwpu.edu.in Trademarks: Copyrights: Trade Secrets: These are symbols, logos, or phrases used to identify and distinguish a particular product or service from others.

Trademarks protect the brand iden tity of a company or individual and prevent others from using similar marks that could confuse consumers. These are legal protections granted to authors, artists, and creators for their original works of expression, such as books, music, \ufb01lms, and software. Copyrights give the creator the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, and display their work. These are con\ufb01dential business information or practices that give a company a competitive advantage. Trade secret protection prevents others from using or disclosing secret information without permission. Overall, IPR plays a crucial role in protecting and incentivizing innovation and creativity by providing legal protections an d \ufb01nancial rewards for the creators and owners of intellectual property. Background information the term \"background information\" in a Collaborative Research and Development programme refers to the technical knowledge and expertise that is owned or controlled by the programme partners before the commencement of the programme. This information is typically in the same \ufb01eld as the programme's subject matter or in related \ufb01elds that are necessary for the successful execution of the programme. The term \"Institute Personnel\" as used in this policy document encompasses a wide range of individuals including but not limited to full-time and part -time faculty members, staff, students, research scholars (both internal and external), visiting scientists, professors, and other professionals who are employed or engaged by the institute. OWNERSHIP OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Whenever the Institute \ufb01les an application for ownership of intellectual property rights, it is require d to acknowledge and mention all individuals who have made signi\ufb01cant intellectual contributions to the creation or invention in question. These individuals must be identi\ufb01ed as inventors or creators in the application. Copyrights The ownership of copyright on all teaching and instructional materials created by employees of the Institute as part of any academic programmes or activities shall belong to the Institute. However, the author(s) of such materials shall retain the right to use the materials in their professional work. This clause does not apply to books, articles, monographs, speeches, and other works produced by the Institute staff members during research and teaching, using Institute resources. The Institute acknowledges and recognizes that the faculty members own the copyright to such traditional works of authorship. In situations where Institute employees have created copyrightable works, including software, using. signi\ufb01cant Institute resources, the Institute may require the employees to assign some or all of the copyright to such works. The extent to which the Institute's resources have been used to produce the copyrightable work will determine the extent of the assignment of the copyright. The Institute shall have ownership of the copyright of works created by non-Institute personnel who are engaged or associated with any Institute activity, regardless of whether Institute personnel have made intellectual contributions to such works or not. In cases where copyrightable works are created during sponsored or collaborative activities, the ownership of copyright shall be determined either in accordance with the terms and conditions related to intellectual property speci\ufb01ed in the contract governing such activity (if any), or through mutual consultations and agreement between the Institute and the sponsoring/collaborating agency. 47 www.mitwpu.edu.in In the case of a thesis, dissertation, or project report written by a student, the ownership of copyright shall be jointly held by the student and their guide. However, the Institute may demand the full assignment of the copyright in such cases. In cases where the Institute does not demand the assignment of copyright or where the copyright has not been assigned to the Institute, the Institute shall be entitled to a non -exclusive, non -transferable lic ense to use the work within the Institute for non-commercial educational and research purposes. Additionally, the Institute may possess a limited number of copies of the work for such purposes. Unless otherwise speci\ufb01ed in the original contract for the work, any copyrightable work that is generated as a work -for-hire shall normally belong to the Institute. If the Institute anticipates a potential \ufb01nancial gain from any copyrights, it may take steps to \ufb01le and protect such copyrights and share the result ing \ufb01nancial bene\ufb01ts with the creator(s) according to the terms and conditions established by the Institute. Institute - Supported Research All intellectual property rights arising from investigations conducted at the Institute using the Institute's resources shall belong to and be the exclusive property of the Institute, except in cases where such investigations are conduct - ed jointly with o ther institutions and agencies or are sponsored by an outside agency. Sponsored Research The intellectual property rights (IPR) of inventions resulting from research projects that are carried out on behalf of and fully funded by a sponsoring agency shall be registered jointly in the name of the Institute and the sponsoring agency if the cost of securing and maintaining the IPR registration is shared equally between the Institute and the sponsoring agency.

Institute - Supported Research All intellectual property rights arising from investigations conducted at the Institute using the Institute's resources shall belong to and be the exclusive property of the Institute, except in cases where such investigations are conduct - ed jointly with o ther institutions and agencies or are sponsored by an outside agency. Sponsored Research The intellectual property rights (IPR) of inventions resulting from research projects that are carried out on behalf of and fully funded by a sponsoring agency shall be registered jointly in the name of the Institute and the sponsoring agency if the cost of securing and maintaining the IPR registration is shared equally between the Institute and the sponsoring agency. However, if the sponsoring agency is not willing to share the costs of registration and maintenance, the IPR shall belong exclusively to the Institute. If the sponsoring agency is not willing to share the cost of securing and maintaining the IPR registration for jointly \ufb01led applications, the Institute may, at its discretion, \ufb01le the application with sole ownership and bear the entire cost of securing and protecting the IPR. In cases where the research project is only partially funded by the sponsoring agency or if there are multiple sponsors for the same project, the sharing of IPR shall be determined through mutual consultations and appropriate agreements between the Institute and the sponsoring agency(ies). If the sponsoring agency is an industry, they may choose one of the following options for sharing the IPR with the Institute: The Institute may enter into an agreement with the sponsoring industry where the ownership of IPR will rest with the industry. However, the industry will have to pay the Institute an initial lump sum and reasonable annual royalties for a speci\ufb01c period as recognition of the Institute's contribution to the project. The terms of ownership of the IPR will be governed by a speci\ufb01c prior agreement between the Institute and the sponsoring industry. The ownership of IPR rested in the sponsoring industry may be exclusive or non -exclusive. In case of exclusive ownership, if the industrial sponsor fails to exploit within a mutually agreed time limit, the Institute may permit third -party exploitation of the IPR. The Institute shall retain ownership of the IPR, but the industrial sponsor shall have the right to exploit the IPR either exclusively or non-exclusively. This right will be granted in exchang e for an initial lump sum payment, subsequent annual royalties for a speci\ufb01ed period, or other bene\ufb01ts to the Institute as mutually agreed upon. In cases of exclusive exploitation rights, if the industrial sponsor fails to exploit the IPR within an agreed -upon time limit, third -party exploitation may be permitted. The Institute shall retain user rights for the purposes of further research and development. The terms of ownership and exploitation rights will be governed by a speci\ufb01c prior agreement between the Institute and the sponsoring industry. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 Joint Research In the case of intellectual property resulting from joint research conducted by Institute personnel with external organizations/agencies/individuals, the ownership of the IP will be jointly shared by the Institute and the collaborators. The cost of \ufb01ling a nd maintaining the IPR as well as the revenue generated from its commercial exploitation will be shared by both parties according to an agreed -upon formula. If the collaborators do not agree to share the cost, the Institute may decide at its discretion to \ufb01le and maintain the IPR at its own expense. In such cases, the sharing of revenue resulting from the commercial exploitation of the IPR will be determined solely by the Institute. Technology Transfer The Institute will make all efforts to commercially exploit the IPR obtained, either solely or jointly with other agencies, to the fullest extent reasonably possible and without unnecessary delay. The marketing of the IPR will be conducted through technology transfer agreements, licensing (both exclusive and non-exclusive), and revenue -sharing models. The Institute will attempt to \ufb01nd potential licensees to commercially exploit the intellectual property (IP) that it owns outright. If the IP is jointly owned, the Institute will offer the \ufb01rst opportunity to commercially exploit it to the joint owners, regardless of whether the IP is protected by patents or not. This licensing agreement would require a lump sum payment as a technology transfer fee, as well as ongoing royalty payments for an agreed -upon period from the start of commercial exploitation. If the joint owner declines this option, the Institute will move forward with commercializing the IP in a manner it sees \ufb01t. If the other collaborating organization or industry does not undertake commercial exploitation within two years from the initial development of the technology, the Institute retains the right to license the use of the intellectual property to a third party. The Institute may support entrepreneurial activities among its staff by transferring ownership of an intellectual property to the inventor(s) or creator(s) of the property, through an agreement. This will enable the staff member s to market, protect, and license the intellectual property independently, with minimal involvement from the Institute. The Institute requires the assignee to pay all expenses related to patenting and licensing, as well as any royalties, equity, or other value received by the inventor(s) or creator(s). The Institute would make efforts to commercialize intellectual property, either through its own means or by hiring a Technology Management Agency to develop the IP created by its staff. After a speci\ufb01ed period, the inventor(s) or creator(s) may request that the Institute transfer the rights",

After a speci\ufb01ed period, the inventor(s) or creator(s) may request that the Institute transfer the rights to them. Revenue Sharing The sole applicant for any intellectual property (IP) generated at MIT-WPU will be the institute itself, and no sharing of revenue will occur, even if the IP is commercialized. However, in cases where the institute chooses to transfer the IP rights to the inventor(s)/creator(s), the inventor(s)/creator(s) will be required to reimburse the institute for all costs incurred in protecting, maintaining, marketing, and otherwise associated with the IP. 48 C MIT-WPU 49 www.mitwpu.edu.in Infringements, Damages, Liability, and Indemnity Insurance As a policy, the Institute will require any licensee to provide indemni\ufb01cation against any legal proceedings, including but not limited to those arising from manufacturing defects, production problems, design guarantees, and obligations related to upgrades and debugging, in any contract between the licensee and the Institute. The Institute will include an indemnity clause in agreements with licensees when transferring technology or copyrighted material, to protect its personne l. The Institute will also retain the right to decide whether or not to engage in any litigation concerning patents and license infringements. Conflict of Interest Inventors must disclose any con\ufb02icts of interest or potential con\ufb02icts of interest. If the inventor(s) or their immediate family have a stake in a licensee or potential licensee company, they must disclose the stake they or their immediate family have in the company. In the case of a license or an assignment of rights for a patent to a company where the inventor(s) have a stake, the approval of the IPR Cell will be required. Dispute Resolution If there are any disputes between the Institute and the inventors concerning the implementation of the IP policy, the aggrieved party can appeal to the Vice Chancellor of the Institute. The Institute will make efforts to address the concerns of the aggrieved party. However, the decision of the Chancellor will be \ufb01nal and binding in this matter. APPLICATION OF POLICY This policy is considered a part of the conditions of employment for every employee of the Institute, as well as a condition of enrollment and attendance for students at the Institute. The policy applies to all existing staff and students upon enrollment. Bottom of Form The Institute retains the right to amend the IPR Policy as necessary or deemed appropriate. All potential cre ators who use Institute -sponsored resources or participate in a sponsored research project must comply with this policy and accept the principles of intellectual property ownership outlined in this policy, unless an exception is approved in writing by the Institute. RIGHT TO REGULATE POLICY The IPR Cell is responsible for interpreting the policy, resolving disputes, and applying the policy. The cell may also recommend changes to the policy p eriodically to the Registrar and Vice Chancellor, who will make decisions on any suggested changes. The IPR policy may be reviewed every three years, or earlier if there is a signi\ufb01cant change in the national policy. LEGAL JURISDICTION As a policy, all ag reements signed by the Institute and any resulting disputes will be subject to the legal jurisdiction of the Court of Adjudication in Pune only. These agreements will be governed by the appropriate laws of India.

IP PROTECTION -SOME EXPLANATORY NOTES (To be read in conjunction with MIT-WPU IPR\u2013Annexure: some useful information on patents and copyright) Intellectual property can take various forms such as patents, industrial designs, trademarks, copyrights, con\ufb01dential information, technical know -how, mask works, processes, plans, speci\ufb01cations, guidelines, graphics, training materials, softwa re programmes, records, drawings, instruction guides, student materials, new techniques, algorithms, concepts, and more. To be protected by MIT World Peace University, the intangible product of the intellect must have potential for industrial application o r for enhancing the S&T knowledge base. A patent can be awarded for any invention that is capable of being commercially applied. To meet the patentability standards, the invention must satisfy the criteria of novelty, utility, and non -obviousness. Addition ally, there must be an inventive step, which refers to an innovation that is not apparent to a person with ordinary skill in the relevant \ufb01eld. The invention may pertain to a new product, an improvement to an existing product, or a new process of manufacturing an existing or new product. Design protection can be obtained for any prototype that in\ufb02uences the consumer's choice by appealing to their aesthetic sense. In simpler terms, design protection can be secured for the appearance, visual features, and overall look of the article. However, design protection is not available for functional features. Patents are intended to safeguard applied and extension research, while copyright law is designed to protect pure or fundamental research.

PROCEDURE FOR IP PROTECTION All patent and copyright applications (as per profo rma MIT -WPU/IPR -01 and MIT -WPU/IPR -02, respectively) must be sent to the Convener/Dean R&D through the IPR Cell via the Dean of the School or Director of the Center, regardless of whether the inventions have resulted from in - house projects or sponsored projects. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 52 MIT-WPU C RECORD KEEPING PROCEDURES All data and details produced by a creator during the creation of intellectual property should be meticulously documented in the relevant School/Centre, with speci\ufb01c emphasis on the following: Avoid using abbreviations or technical terms that are not commonly understood, unless they are explained in a table at the beginning or end of the book. This will ensure that readers who are not familiar with the terminology can understand the text without confusion or dif\ufb01culty. Important information such as data, descriptions, or experiments that pertain to signi\ufb01cant inventions or discoveries should be attributed and documented by the individual(s) responsible for the project, such as the creator, supervisor, or coordinator. I. Any changes that need to be made should be indicated by crossing out the deleted content and labeling it as \"cancelled\". The corrected data, clearly marked as such, should be entered immediately below and authenticated by the creator with their initials an d the date. II. In cases where new products are created or produced by a new method, it is advisable to preserve samples and take photographs for record keeping purposes. All photographs should be dated and signed by the creator on the back. When Should Faculty Approach IPR Cell To Discuss a Possible Patent? MIT-WPU has established an exclusive IPR Cell to manage intellectual property rights. Faculty members who have created potential intellectual property while employed by MIT-WPU can approach the IPR Cell advisor to arrange a discussion at a mutually convenient time. It is recommended that this discussion occurs well in advance of the idea maturing into a process or product. If the invention is only in the conception stage, it is possible to \ufb01le a provisional speci\ufb01cation, which must be followed up with a complete speci\ufb01cation within 12 months; otherwise, the patent application will be considered abandoned. However, if the inventor has an innovative product that can be immediately marketed, a complete speci\ufb01cation can be lod ged right away. EVALUATION OF PATENT/COPYRIGHT APPLICATIONS The IPR Cell will receive and examine each patent/copyright application submitted through an Invention Disclosure Form/Copyright Disclosure form according to the MIT-WPU/IPR -01/MIT -WPU/IPR -02 proforma. Additionally, an IPR facilitation request (MIT -WPU/IPR -03) must be included. The committee may request assistance from other professors who are experts in the relevant \ufb01eld to conduct an initial evaluation of proposals for their potential patentability. These domain experts will be required to sign a non-Disclosure agreement according to the MIT -WPU/IPR -04 proforma and a No Con\ufb02ict -of-Interest Form according to the MIT -WPU/IPR -05 profor ma before being granted access to the proposal. If necessary, the inventors may be asked to present their case before the IPR Cell. If the Cell recommends \ufb01ling for patents, the Convener of the IPR Cell will facilitate the application through one of the a pproved attorneys from the panel maintained by the IPR Cell. ASSISTANCE IN FILLING THE PROFORMA Once the IPR Cell approves protecting the Intellectual output, a patent Attorney shall be identi\ufb01ed by the Cell for drafting the IP application. The following aspects need to receive attention: Objective of the invention: What problem is the inventor trying to solve? What are the issues involved? The objective of the invention should clearly state the problem that the inventor is trying to solve. This should be a concise statement that identi\ufb01es the issues involved in the invention. For example, the objective of the invention might be to develop a more ef\ufb01cient method for processing data or to create a new device that solves a speci\ufb01c problem in a particular industry. 53 www.mitwpu.edu.in What prior art searches have been made?

Who are responsible for administration of IPRs in the country? The Controller General of Patents, Designs, and Trademarks is responsible for overseeing patents, designs, and trademarks. This department operates under the Ministry of Industry's Department of Industrial Development. Copyright, on the other hand, falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Human Resource Development. 4. What is a patent? A patent is a legal monopoly which is granted for a limited time to the owner of an invention. Patent rights A patent is a legal right granted by the state that provides a limited -time monopoly to the owner of an invention. Simply possessing a patent does not automatically give the owner the right to use or exploit the patented invention; other laws and regulations, such as those governing health and safety, food and drugs, and inheritance, may also affect these rights. Patent rights can be sold, licensed, inherited, abandoned, and may even be subject to revocation by the state in certain circumstances, both before and aft er the grant of the patent. Additionally, there are global patents available for international protection. 55 www.mitwpu.edu.in 5. What is the distinction between patented invention and know -how? According to the law, a patent speci\ufb01cation does not have to disclose all the information required for the commercial exploitation of the invention. Therefore, the information provided in a patent speci\ufb01cation may not be suf\ufb01cient for commercialization purposes. In contrast, known -how refers to all the information necessary for commercializing an invention, such as details of production methods and design drawings needed to set up a production plant. If known -how is developed around an existing patent and subsequently commercialized without the patentee's agreement, it may be considered an infringement of the patent unless the patentee has agreed to such commercialization on mutually. Agreed terms. 6. How is an invention interpreted? For an invention to be considered patentable, it must not only be novel, but also involve an inventive step. This means that the invention must not be obvious to a person skilled in the relevant \ufb01eld, taking into consideration the state of the art, but disregarding unpublished pending patent applications. However, simplicity is not necessarily a barrier to securing a patent. The means of achieving the desired outcome may be simple and common, but an inventive step may still exist if the inventor has developed a variant that produces more useful results. It does not matter whether the invention was developed by accident, as long as it involves some level of inventive step. Whether or not it has been in the meantime sold or licensed. There is no such thing as What are patentable inventions under the patent Act, 1970? Invention means any new and useful: Art, process, method, or manner of manufacture Machines, apparatus, or another article Substances produced by manufacture and included any new and useful improvements of any of them and an alleged invention. However, inventions claiming substances intended for use; or capable of being used, as food or as medicine of drug or relating to subst ances prepared or produced by chemical processes (including alloys, optical glass, semi -conductors, and inter -metallic compounds) are not patentable. 7. How is the novelty of and invention determined? The novelty of an invention is determined based on the knowledge that is available globally, including in India, at the time of \ufb01ling the patent application. This means that the invention should not have been known or disclosed to the public anywhere in the world before the \ufb01ling date of the patent application . 8. What are the types of inventions which are not patentable? An invention which is frivolous, or which claims anything obviously contrary to well established natural laws e.g., different types of perpetual motion or machines which violate the third law of thermodynamics. An invention that has a primary or intended use which is contrary to law or morality or injurious to public health is not considered patentable. For example, a process for preparing a beverage that involves the use of a carcinogenic substance, even if the beverage has a higher nourishment value, would not be considered patentable. The mere discovery of a scienti\ufb01c principle or the form ulation of an abstract theory is not patentable. For example, the discovery of the Raman Effect, which is a scienti\ufb01c principle, cannot be patented. However, an invention that makes use of scienti\ufb01c principle or theory can be patented if it meets the criteria of novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability. To be patentable, the invention must involve an inventive step. Thus, the mere discovery of any new property or",

Thus, the mere discovery of any new property or new use of a known substance or the mere use of a known process, machine or apparatus is not considered patentable, unless such a known process results in a new product or employs at least one new reactant. In other words, there must be some degree of i nnovation and improvement in the known substance or process to be eligible for a patent. A substance that is created by simply mixing existing substances together, resulting only in the combination of their properties, is not patentable. The same applies to a process for creating such a substance. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 56 MIT-WPU C The mere arrangement, rearrangement, or duplication of features of known devices, each functioning independently of one another in a known way, is not considered an invention and hence not patentable. In other words, a patent cannot be granted for a combin ation of known features that does not result in any new or improved function or technical effect. A method or process of testing applicable during the process of manufacture for rendering the machine, apparatus, or other equipment more ef\ufb01cient. A method of agriculture or horticulture. Any process for medicinal, surgical, curative, prophylactic or other treatment of human \u2018beings, or any process for a simila r treatment of animals or plants. Invention relating to atomic energy. 9. When should an application for a patent be \ufb01led? a) It is important to \ufb01le a patent application as soon as possible, rather than waiting until the invention is fully developed for commercial use. Filing an application with a provisional speci\ufb01cation can help establish priority for the applicant. Delay in \ufb01ling an application can lead to risks such as other inventors applying for a patent for the same invention before the \ufb01rst inventor, or inadvertent publica tion of the invention by the inventor or others independently. What are the essential patent documents to be generated and submitted by a potential patentee? b) There are two types of patent documents usually known as patent speci\ufb01cation namely. Provisional speci\ufb01cation Complete speci\ufb01cation PROVISIONAL SPECIFICATION To add to the previous answer, a complete speci\ufb01cation is a detailed description of the invention and how to make and use it. It should include claims that de\ufb01ne the scope of the invention for which protection is sought. The claims must be clear, concise, and supported by the description. The complete speci\ufb01cation must be \ufb01led within 12 months from the date of \ufb01ling the provisional speci\ufb01cation, and failure to do so will result in the abandonment of the application. It's also worth noting that while a provisional speci\ufb01cation may be \ufb01led without any claims, the complete speci\ufb01cation must include at least one claim de\ufb01ning the scope of the invention. The claims must be carefully drafted to ensure that they are not overly broad or vague, which could result in the patent being challenged or invalidated later. The provisional speci\ufb01cation is not a permanent and independent scienti\ufb01c cum legal document. It is a temporary document \ufb01led to establish priority of the invention and to secure a \ufb01ling date. Amendments to the provisional speci\ufb01cation can be made at any time before \ufb01ling a complete speci\ufb01cation. However, once a complete speci\ufb01cation is \ufb01led, amendments to the provisional speci\ufb01cation are not allowed. COMPLETE SPECIFICATION To obtain a patent, it is necessary to submit a Complete Speci\ufb01cation. This speci\ufb01cation should include informa - tion about the \ufb01eld to which the invention relates, the background of the prior art, any drawbacks related to the previously known details of the invention, the best way of carrying out the invention, and claims that de\ufb01ne the scope of the invention. The Complete Speci\ufb01cation should provide enough information to enable a person skilled in the art to work on the invention without requiring assistance from the inventor. 57 www.mitwpu.edu.in 10. What are the criteria for naming inventors(s) in an application for patent? The naming of inventors is normally decided based on the following criteria: All persons who have contributed towards the conception or reduction to practice of at least one claim of the invention should be named as an inventor. Intellectual contribution towards the results of the research work leading to a patent is not suf\ufb01cient for being named as an inventor. Contribution towards the conception or reduction to practice of at least one claim of the invention is necessary. A person who has not contributed to the conception or reduction to practice of at least one claim of the invention is not entitled to be included as an inventor. A person who provides only routine assistance, such as making dr awings or constructing a prototype under the direction of an inventor, is not entitled to be named as an inventor. Dif\ufb01culties may arise in determining who should be named as an inventor, and to avoid such situations,",

Dif\ufb01culties may arise in determining who should be named as an inventor, and to avoid such situations, it is important for all researchers to maintain clear and accurate records of their work in a consecutively numbered diary, with entries signed by both the researchers and their team leader. 11. Can a published or disclosed invention be patented? To clarify, if an inventor publicly discloses their invention before \ufb01ling a patent application, it could potentially prevent them from obtaining a patent. This is because one of the requirements for obtaining a patent is that the invention must be new and non -obvious at the time the patent application is \ufb01led. If the invention has already been publi cly disclosed, it may no longer meet the novelty requirement. Therefore, it is generally recommended that inventors do not disclose their inventions publicly before \ufb01ling a patent application. Instead, they should keep their invention con\ufb01dential and \ufb01le a patent application as soon as possible. If an inventor does choose to disclose their invention before \ufb01ling a patent application, they may still be able to obtain a patent if they \ufb01le the application within a certain time frame. In the United States, for example, inventors have one year from the date of the \ufb01rst public disclosure to \ufb01le a patent application. If an inventor does obtain a patent, they should include the patent number and date in any subsequent publications or disclosures related to the invention. This provides information to the public about the existence of the patent and its scope of protection. 12. What is considered the date of patent? The date on which the complete speci\ufb01cation is \ufb01led is considered the date of patent, and it is a crucial date for determining the legal protection of the invention covered by the patent. The term of the patent is calculated from this date, and it is from this date that the exclusive rights of the patent holder begin. 13. What is the term of a patent in Indian system? The term of every patent in India is 20 years, starting from the date of \ufb01ling of the patent application, regardless of whether it was \ufb01led with a provisional or complete speci\ufb01cation. However, for applications \ufb01led under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), the term of 20 years begins from the international \ufb01ling date. 14. How does one keep a patent in force for the full patent terms? To maintain a patent's validity, the patent holder is required to pay renewal fees at regular intervals. If the renewal fees are not paid, the patent will expire and will no longer be legally enforceable. Once a patent has expired, the invention becomes open to the public, and anyone can use, manufacture or sell the invention without permission from the original patent holder. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 58 MIT-WPU C 15. What is expected from a patentee? As per Indian patent law, it is expected that a patent holder should work their invention in India on a commercial scale and without any unnecessary delay. A patent is not granted simply to provide a monopoly to the patent holder for importing the patented product into India. This means that a patent holder ca nnot simply hold onto their invention and prevent others from using it. The intention behind granting a patent is to promote innovation and encourage the progress of technology, and to ensure that the invention is being utilized for the bene\ufb01t of society. 16. What is the nature of the information needed while consulting a patent attorney? When working with a patent agent or attorney to \ufb01le a patent application, it is important to provide them with a clear and comprehensive explanation of the invention. This may include information about the history of the invention, including where the idea came from and how it was developed. Any early failures or prototypes may also be relevant to understanding the inventive step involved in the invention. It is important to highlight what you believe to be the most central and inventive aspect of the invention, as well as any similar prior inventions that may exist. If you have developed an improved version of a competitor's product, it is important to disclose this information to the patent agent. Honesty and transparency in these matters will help the patent agent to draft claims and speci \ufb01cations that accurately re\ufb02ect the invention and avoid any potential for excessive claims that could be rejected. By providing your patent agent with a comprehensive understanding of your invention, including its history, inventive elements, and any prio r inventions or improvements, they will be better equipped to draft a strong patent application that maximizes the protection of your invention. In order to \ufb01le a strong patent application, it is important to provide a detailed description of how the inve ntion can be practically used, as well as any test results or trials conducted",

This includes any failures or defects encountered during testing, as well as any alternative ways of using the invention or potential substitutes for its parts. It may be worthwhile to draft the patent application in such a way that it covers a broad range of alternatives, including less satisfactory options, to prevent competitors from marketing subpar products that could tarnish the reputation of the entire product genre. During the patent application process, it is import ant to respond quickly and accurately to any queries from the patent agent. This will help to keep the application on track and save time and money. As the inventor, it is also important to keep the patent agent informed of any new developments or improvem ents made to the invention, as well as any new competitors that may arise. This will help the patent agent to draft a strong and effective patent application that accurately re\ufb02ects the invention and provides maximum protection. 59 www.mitwpu.edu.in 17.

To communicate the sound recording to the public Explanation: For the purpose of this section, a copy which has been sold once shall be deemed to be a copy already in circulation. 19. How is a computer de\ufb01ned for the purpose of copyright? Computers include any electronic or similar device having information processing capabilities. 20. What is the de\ufb01nition of a computer programme? A computer programme refers to a sequence of instructions, expressed in various forms such as words, codes, schemes or other formats, that enables a computer to perform a speci\ufb01c task or achieve a particular result. This sequence of instructions may be stored on a machine -readable medium, such as a hard drive, USB drive or other similar storage device, and can be executed by a computer processor to perform various functions or tasks. In essence, a computer programme is a collection of instructions that a computer can follow to perform a speci\ufb01c task or series of tasks. 21. What is the term of a copyright? The term of copyright protection for a literary work published during the author's lifetime is the life of the author plus 60 years. This means that the copyright protection lasts for the entire lifetime of the author and for 60 years after their death. The term of copyright protection for cinematographic \ufb01lms, records, photographs, posthumous publications, anonymous publications, works of government, and international agencies is 60 years from the beginning of the calendar year following the year in which the work was published. This means that copyright protection lasts for 60 years from the year after the publication year. The term of copyright protection for broadcasting is 25 years from the beginning of the calendar year following the year in which the broadcast was made. This means that copyright protection lasts for 25 years from the year after the year in which the broadcast was made. 61 www.mitwpu.edu.in IPR POLICY IPR is a general term covering patents, registered design, trademarks, copyright, and layout design of integrated circuits, trade secrets, geographical indicators, and anti-competitive practices in contractual licenses. The Intellectual Property could be protected in the form of: Patent (to be registered) , Design Registrations (to be registered) , Trademark (registered or otherwise) , Copyright refers to the legal protection granted to the creators of original works of authorship, such as literary, artistic, and musical works, in various forms including registered or unregistered. In the context of the Institute, it may include plans, speci\ufb01cations, guidelines, graphics, training materials, software programmes, records, drawings, instruction guides, student materials, new techniques, algorithms, concepts, and other forms of creative expression. Con\ufb01dential information and technical know -how may also be protected under copy right law if they are embodied in original works of authorship. Mask works, which are designs used to create semiconductor chips, may also be protected under copyright law. Additionally, copyright protection may extend to the processes used to create works of authorship, such as the techniques used to produce a particular type of artwork or the algorithms used to generate computer programmes. Intellectual Property (IP) refers to intangible creations of the mind, such as inventions, ideas, designs, software programmes, and other forms of knowledge. It includes all results, conclusions, deductions, improvements, discoveries, solutions, processes, modi\ufb01cations, data, and information generated or produced by the faculty, staff, students, research scholars, and other employees of the Institute. IP is the result of research activities supported or sponsored by the Institute, industrial consulting, or other forms of joint research and development work. The ownership of IP resulting from such activities is determined by the Institute's IP policy. A patent application accompanied by a provisional application does not provide legal rights to the applicants. However, it is a crucial document that establishes the earliest ownership of an invention. This can be important in cases where multiple parties claim ownership of an invention. The provisional application establishes the priority date of the invention, which can be crucial in determining who has the right to \ufb01le a patent application \ufb01rst. SALIENT FEATURES OF IPR AND SERVICES PROVIDED BY IPR CELL RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 MIT-WPU C EXCEPTIONS FOR PATENT: To clarify, inventions that claim substances that are intended for use as food, medicine, or drugs, or that are capable of being used as such, are not patentable. Similarly, inventions that relate to substances that are prepared or produced by chemical processes, including alloys, optical glass, semi -conductors, and inter -metallic compounds, are also not patentable. WHETHER PATENT CAN BE REVOKED: Since a patent is granted by the state, it can also be revoked by the state under certain circumstances, even after it has been granted. It's important to note that a patent can be revoked by the state regardless of whether it has been sold or licensed in the meantime. CONTEST/CONFLICT WITH SPONSORING AGENCY: If the sponsoring agency does not cooperate in \ufb01ling a joint intellectual property rights (IPR) application, the Institute may choose to \ufb01le the application on its own with complete ownership and will bear all costs associated with securing and protecting the IPR. Copyright law protects pure or basic research, whereas patents seek to protect applied and extended research. If the intellectual property results from joint research carried out by Institute personnel and external organizations/ agencies/individuals, the ownership of the IP will be shared jointly by the Institute and the collaborators. In such cases, the Institut e will have the \ufb01rst right to commercially exploit the joint IP, regardless of whether it has been formally protected by patent(s) or not. IP COUNSELLING: The IPR cell will provide guidance and support to potential inventors of intellectual products and will assist the Institute in identifying the potential for IPR. If the cell recommends \ufb01ling for patents, the Convener/Dean R&D through the IPR cell will process the application through an approved attorney from the panel maintained by the IPR cell.

If any copyrightable work is created during sponsored or collaborative activities, ownership of the copyright will be determined by the terms and conditions outlined in the relevant contract or through mutual agreement with the sponsoring/collaborating agency. All faculty members, staff, students, research scholars (internal and external), visiting scientists, professors, and other professionals, whether full-time or part -time, can avail themselves of the services provided by the IPR cell. MIT -WPU has established sy stems and mechanisms to facilitate the commercial exploitation of the knowledge generated at the Institute under the provisions of the IPR regime in the country. SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE IPR CELL: It is crucial to respond promptly and accurately to queries from the patent agent both during the initial search and throughout the patent application process. This will facilitate the progress of the patent application and potentially save money. The IPR cell will periodically suggest patentable technologi es to potential licensing agencies, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), and other \ufb01nancial institutions, encouraging them to invest in venture capital for new technologies. 63 www.mitwpu.edu.in Is it possible to utilize the services of MIT -WPU IPR Cell to apply for a patent and get it granted? Certainly, I understand. The IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) Cell at MIT -WPU is responsible for assisting faculty members, research associates, research scholars, students, and other researchers working at MIT -WPU in obtaining patents for their inventio ns. In what proportion would the expenditure to be incurred for getting the patent granted be shared between MIT -WPU and the inventors? To clarify, if an inventor processes their patent application through MIT-WPU IPR Cell and MIT-WPU is designated as the assignee for the granted patent, then MIT-WPU is responsible for paying the fees associated with the various stages of the patent application process. In this case, the inventor is not required to pay any fees. If the expenditure to be incurred for the patenting process is fully borne by MIT-WPU, what will be royalty share for inventors after the patent is granted and we go for commercialization? As MIT-WPU is the sole applicant, there is no revenue sharing model, even for commercialized patents. Can you help us with the complete rules and regulations of the patent application and regulations followed by the MIT -WPU IPR Cell? Please go through the links \u2018frequently asked questions\u2019 and \u2018IPR Policy\u2019 under \u201cIPR Cell\u201d link at MIT-WPU Website. Is it possible to apply for a patent as an individual without help from MIT -WPU? To put it another way, if the invention is the result of work conducted by a researcher during their time at MIT-WPU and if the facilities provided by MIT -WPU were utilized in the creation of the invention, then it is expected that the inventor will \ufb01le their patent application through the MIT -WPU IPR Cell and designate MIT -WPU as the assignee. If the patent application is not processed through MIT -WPU IPR Cell, will MIT -WPU still \ufb01nancially support the patenting process? To rephrase, if the inventor chooses not to apply for a patent through the MIT-WPU IPR Cell, then MIT-WPU will not assume any responsibility for the costs associated with the patenting process. What is the documentation to be submitted to IPR Cell and what is the mode of submission, when one makes a beginning with patenting his invention? The Inventor is required to submit their proposal in the format of an Invention Disclosure Form (IDF) when making their proposal. It's important to note that the format of the IDF differs depending on whether it is for a patent or a design registration. The blank IDF for patent or design registration can be downloaded from the IPR Cell link on the MIT -WPU website. It's worth noting that there have been instances where Inventors have submitted Forms 1, 2, 3, and 5 of the Indian Patents Act 1970 as part of their proposal. However, it's important to remember that these forms are not required to be submitted to the IPR Cell. Instead, only the IDF is necessary for submitting the proposal. If the proposal is for a design registration, the Inventors must enter into an \"Agreement on Designs\" with MIT -WPU on a non -judicial stamp paper worth Rs. 20. A template for the agreement can be downloaded from the IPR Cell link on the MIT -WPU website. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ) RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 MIT-WPU C Which are the points which need particular attention, while \ufb01lling in the Invention Disclosure Form (IDF) for patents? The following points in IDF require particular attention: Point 8: General area of the patent: Please be speci\ufb01c.

The policy encompasses all forms of research that involve human participants, their tissues, or data, and should also be applied more broadly to activities such as enterprise and innovation, or service evaluation and audit, where ethical issues may arise. These policies are applicable to all research conducted by MIT-WPU's faculty and students. For studies that have obtained external ethical approval, there is no need to repeat the process. The appropriate University Ethics Committee must be informed and provided with a copy of the approval. The Ethics Committee will con\ufb01rm that no additional approval is necessary for the study. This policy is applicable to all individuals conducting research either within the University or on behalf of it. This includes staff, individuals with honorary University appointments, visiting researchers, undergraduate and postgraduate students, as well as visiting scholars and students. When a research project is being carried out by academics from multiple institutions, the lead institution (usually the institution where the Principal Investigator is employed) should seek the relevant ethical clearance for the project, and other partner institutions should be informed of any outcomes and issues. PURPOSE The aim of this policy and procedure is to establish and promote the highest ethical standards in academic research. The University is dedicated to safeguarding the rights, dignity, safety, and privacy of research subjects, as well as the well -being of animals, and ensuring environmental protection. Additionally, the University is committed to minimizing health and safety risks for researchers and upholding their academic freedom. The Institutional Ethics Committee of MIT-WPU will evaluate and approve all research proposals involving human participants, taking into account the welfare and safety of actual and potential research participants. The goals of research, no matter how important, should never be prioritized over the health and well -being of the research subjects. GUIDELINES Researchers af\ufb01liated with MIT-WPU must seek approval from the Ethics Committee. The ethical review process should ensure adherence to the following policy documents of MIT-WPU. a. Policy for Promotion of Research b. Plagiarism Policy c. Patent Policy d. Consultancy Policy ETHICS COMMITTEE 77 www.mitwpu.edu.in The University mandates an ethical review of all research projects that involve primary research with human subjects (or their data), regardless of funding source. In most cases, a review would be conducted by a Research Ethics Committee. Projects involving living persons, human tissues, or data related to recently deceased persons, as well as projects involving animals (including animals living in their natural habitats), must have genuine research, educational, or training purpose. Ethical approval is required for all research involving human participants, human material, or human data. Howe ver, research that uses information about human participants that is publicly and lawfully available, such as census data, population statistics, court reports, and personal letters or diaries in public libraries, is exempt from this requirement. The University has a Code of Ethics for Research that includes funda mental principles to protect human participants. The University requires that all research falling under this policy must adhere to the Code of Ethics and its fundamental principles. The University's policies,",

Projects involving living persons, human tissues, or data related to recently deceased persons, as well as projects involving animals (including animals living in their natural habitats), must have genuine research, educational, or training purpose. Ethical approval is required for all research involving human participants, human material, or human data. Howe ver, research that uses information about human participants that is publicly and lawfully available, such as census data, population statistics, court reports, and personal letters or diaries in public libraries, is exempt from this requirement. The University has a Code of Ethics for Research that includes funda mental principles to protect human participants. The University requires that all research falling under this policy must adhere to the Code of Ethics and its fundamental principles. The University's policies, committees, and sub -committees must consider the relevant professional ethical codes and research sponsor policies. If there is a difference in ethical standards between the University policy and the relevant professional body or research sponsor, the committees should apply the highest standard of ethical practice. Research ethics committees should be appropriate to the disciplinary mix of research they will review, comply with speci\ufb01c funding or professional body requirements, and comply with relevant legislative requirements. They should also consider the anticipated volume of work. Every research ethics committee should not only take the responsibility of reviewing and approving all research within its jurisdiction but also create and endorse research ethics toolkits. These toolkits should include standard consent forms, participant information sheets, and protocols for ensuring security, con\ufb01dentiality, anonymization, and retention o f data. It is essential for all research ethics committees to maintain detailed records of their proceedings and decisions. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 MIT-WPU C APPLICATION AND APPEALS PROCEDURE APPLICATIONS FOR ETHICAL APPROVAL The Institutional Research Ethics Board ethical committee will consider the following matters when reviewing applications for ethical approval, considering their relevance to the research project: The risk of physical, emotional, or reputational harm to research participants, and the steps that will be taken to minimize or mitigate these risks. The risk of physical or emotional harm to the researcher, and the steps that will be taken to minimize or mitigate these risks. The procedures for recruiting research participants and obtaining their informed consent, including the provision of participant information sheets and consent forms. The rationale for using observation or covert surveillance, or any other methods that may not be transparent to research participants. The measures that will be taken to ensure the security and con\ufb01dentiality of personal data and any human tissues or artefacts collected for the project, particularly those that will be stored or processed off-site. The arrangements for the retention, anonymization, and disposal of personal data, artefacts, or tissues at the end of the project, or as required by research sponsors or legal provisions. The procedures for debrie\ufb01ng research participants, particularly in cases where the research may have caused them distress. The procedures for reporting and dealing with any adverse reactions to the research project. The measures that will be taken to ensure that appropriate Ethical Board checks are conducted when researchers are working in settings where children or vulnerable adults may be present. If ethical approval is not granted or if signi\ufb01cant modi\ufb01cations are required for the proposed research, the Institutional Research Ethics Board must provide detailed written feedback to the applicant. In the case of research students, the feedback must also be provided to their Director of Studies or Lead Supervisor, as appropriate. If the issue cannot be resolved informally, applicants have the right to appeal. APPEALS If there are statutory requirements that specify different procedures for appeals, these will take precedence over the appeals procedures outlined in this Policy. Researchers who are bound by their own professional code of conduct should be aware that their own ethics policies may be more rigorous than those outlined in this Policy, and they must comply with their professional codes. Failure to comply with ethics approval may be deemed as serious professional misconduct, which the university is obligated to report to the researcher's professional body. 79 www.mitwpu.edu.in INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH ETHICS BOARD The university shall establish an Institutional Research Ethics Board to ensure that research activities conducted by researchers are fully compliant with the university's regulations on research ethics and the protectio n of human and non- human subjects involved in research.

The university has an obligation to safeguard public funds and ensure that it delivers the assured value for mo ney to its students and other beneficiaries. The Tuition Fee Policy forms part of the university\u2019s Terms and Conditions and should be read in conjunction with them, for together they provide the comprehensive framework for the setting, payment, collection, and reconciliation of tuition fees. Course fees include all compulsory elements needed for students to meet the minimum learning outcomes of the course. In some courses, optional additional costs may be incurred. The purpose of this policy is to set out the tuition fee liability that applies to students upon enrolment on a course/programme of study. Scope This policy relates to: \u27a2 Student tuition fee liability This policy does not relate to: \u27a2 Non-refundable tuition fee deposits \u27a2 Accommodation fees 37 | P a g e Policy \u27a2 All students bear a personal liability for the tuition fee associated with any course/programme of study for which they enrol. \u27a2 All students must enrol for each successive year or another relevant part of their course/courses at MIT World Peace University no later than 30 days after the stating date of the respective course/courses). o Upon non -completion of enrolment by/before the prescribed deadline dates, students will be withdrawn from their ongoing course. Once withdrawn, the students\u2019 ID card will be deactivated following which they will not be able to attend lectures, use the libr ary, submit, or sit for assessments or take part in any other academic activity. \u27a2 The University has a ' fixed fee ' policy for tuition fee meaning that the fee charged at the beginning of the programme remains the same throughout that particular programme. \u27a2 The ' fixed fee ' policy will apply even if a student interrupts or repeats another year of study. \u27a2 It is the students\u2019 responsibility to ensure that they will be able to pay for their entire course duration prior to enrolment. \u27a2 Enrolment will not be permitted unless any/all outstanding debt(s) from the previous year has been paid in full or an instalment plan has been agreed upon by the university\u2019s Fee Team. \u27a2 IMPORTANT: Students are legally responsible for payment of their complete tuition fee themselves, whether they have an SLC loan or a sponsor. If the sponsor does not pay the university, or if the students find out that they are not eligible for a SLC loan, or they lose 38 | P a g e their eligibility for an SLC loan at any time after the commencement of the course, the students will be liable to pay their own fees for any/all periods of study that is not paid for by a sponsor or the SLC. This applies to all forms of undergraduate and postgraduate fee. \u27a2 Students who are considering discontinuing their programme of study are encouraged to first consult with the University for Advice and Guidance before making the final decision to leave. Further information on the range of support available can be found on the university website. \u27a2 In all cases, wherein a student withdraws from or discontinues their studies, or is granted a period of leave of absence from their studies, the date of withdrawal/discontinuation/leave of absence is accounted for by the university towards calculating the cumulative tuition fee liability. \u27a2 For students who are sponsored, in the event of the sponsor not making payment in respect of the tuition fees, the student will be personally liable for the payment. \u27a2 Students funded by the Student Loans Company (SLC) will be liable for payment of either 50% or 100% of the tuition fee loan, in line with SLC policy in case of discontinuation mid - programme. For undergraduate students starting in August, the liability will stand at 50% in case the withdrawal takes place before course commencement & remaining 50% will be liable after completion of 90 days from the course commencement date. \u27a2 The university reserves the right to take appropriate action against students who fail to pay their fees, or make satisfactory arrangements to pay on, or by the end of a set period after the starting date of their course. When to pay fees: Students either can make the full payment or can opt for the payment in instalments as per the fee payment schedule declared and published by the university. First Installment Fee will have to be paid in full for the seat to be confirmed in candidate \u2019s name (no parti al payments are permitted) . How to pay fees: 39 | P a g e The University is committed to offering a simplified payment experience, which is both secure and safe.

Awards Funding Amount: 25K to 3L Duration of Project: 6 months to 3 years (Progress evaluation after every 6 months) Selection Criteria The R&D Cell will issue a call for proposals once a year, and individual faculty or a group of faculties along with the student members can submit their applications. An innovation screening committee will be established to review the proposals according to a prede\ufb01ned process, and the committee will make recommendations or non-recommendations for individual projects. The endorsement of an innovation project will depend on the innovation funds resulting in a solution for current technical and social challenges that eventually leads to the generation of intellectual property that can be marketed and has potent ial for commercial success through technology transfer. Teams of students are also eligible to apply for innovation funds. The teams will be required to present their ideas before a panel of experts and industry sponsors, following a \u2018Shark Tank\u2019 model.

Alongside its undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, MIT -WPU also encourages its faculty members and academic staff to undertake consultancy projects with industry and other institutions. This not only expands and strengthens the research pro\ufb01le of MIT-WPU but also creates new knowledge and broadens the experience of faculty and staff members. This document provid es a formal framework to guide the implementation of this process. AIM OF THE DOCUMENT MIT-WPU aims to be a university that fosters innovation and is committed to adopting best practices in its engagement with external organizations. The university rec ognizes that consultancy work and external activity undertaken by its staff are crucial and valuable aspects of its operations. MIT-WPU believes that such activities are essential for knowledge exchange and can result in mutually bene\ufb01cial outcomes for both, the university and external organizations. To support its staff in the delivery of approved consultancy work, MIT -WPU has established a policy that outlines the procedures and guidelines to be followed. This policy is a part of the university's human resources management procedures and forms a part of the contract of employment for the academic staff. PURPOSE The objective of this policy is to establish the rules and regulations that govern consultancy and other external service s provided by the staff of MIT -WPU. MIT-WPU acknowledges the signi\ufb01cance of its staff engaging in consultancy for external organizations, particularly for the industry. MIT -WPU recognizes this as a vital medium through which knowledge and expertise can be shared with and from businesses and other external agencies, thereby promoting the development of mutually bene\ufb01cial relationships with these organizations. Thus, MIT -WPU promotes and supports its staff members to under take consultancy and similar work, as long as it does not contradict the interests of MIT -WPU. It is expected by MIT -WPU that external consultancy engagement will be undertaken with the highest levels of professionalism and integrity by staff members. MIT-WPU expects that the consultancy work will contribute to the development of mutually bene\ufb01cial relationships with external organizations, including industry bodies, and that it will further enhance the knowledge and expertise of staff members, thus supporting the overall development of MIT-WPU. The policy aims to provide guidance and support to staf f members in undertaking consultancy work in a way that is consistent with the interests of MIT-WPU and ensures transparency, ethical practice, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations. Benefits of engagement: External consultancy provides an opportunity for the staff members to increase their professional and/or academic competence and experience, and a chance for continuing professional education by working with industry. Engaging in external consultancy can help to create and su stain relationships between MIT -WPU and external organizations, leading to bene\ufb01ts such as increased research opportunities, student admission and placement, and ultimately contributing to knowledge exchange for the bene\ufb01t of the country. External consultancy can also generate additional income for the staff members and increased funding for MIT-WPU. MIT-WPU CONSULTANCY POLICY RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 24 www.mitwpu.edu.in APPLICABILITY MIT-WPU aims to promote and support consultancy work among its staff members in accordance with the University's employment policies and regulations. Academic staff are encouraged to engage in consultancy work that aligns with their respective disciplines and does not hinder their primary role within their department. This policy is applicable to all academic, academic -related, and administrative staff members of MIT-WPU and is to be adhered to in uniformity.

If issues are problematic, approval of the Pro-Vice Chancellor/Vice Chancellor shall be sought before \ufb01nal sign -off. If a client insists on an agreement on their terms, R&D will review the Client's terms and conditions, in consultation with the Legal Department of MIT-WPU, for acceptance or renegotiation. Any agreement outside of the approved standard terms and conditions can only be entered into after approval from MIT-WPU's management and shall be done by R&D. EARNINGS DISTRIBUTION MODEL The distribution model is based on income per consultancy agreement per \ufb01nancial year. Sr. No. Earnings PI & Team** MIT-WPU 1 Intellectual Consultancy 80% 20% 2 MIT-WPU Consultancy 70% 30% 3 Testing and Evaluation 60% 40% 4 Standardization and Calibration 60% 40% **The applicable income tax and other statutory taxes will be deducted from the staff's payment, and they will receive only the net amount after deductions. The payment cannot be given in cash or any other form for personal bene\ufb01t and will be paid only ele ctronically into the individual's salary bank account. The share mentioned is in addition to the individual's regular salary. Each Consultancy Agreement contract will have a unique price that will be determined on a case -by-case basis, taking into consideration the client and the nature of the project. The maximum consultancy income permissible for a staff member under the standard distribution model shall not exceed their total salary for the year, which includes basic pay and standard allowances like dearness allowance but does not include other payments such as ex-gratia, monetary or non-monetary awards. This limit applies in any \ufb01nancial year, and any amount exceeding this limit shall be deposited into MIT -WPU's Research Fund. The creation of teaching and academic materials as well as other publications such as books and articles in a consultancy project will be subject to MIT-WPU's Policy on Intellectual Property. 29 MIT-WPU C CLARIFICATIONS For all matters not covered in this document, as a general principle, Dean R&D / Director R&D may be approached for clari\ufb01cations required, if any. GENERAL All payments made for consultancy services must be processed through MIT -WPU's designated bank a ccount. This means that payments should be made in the name of MIT -WPU and not directly to individual faculty members. MIT-WPU will ensure compliance with statutory laws and distribute the appropriate share to the faculty/staff involved in the consultancy project. The client shall not be provided with a detailed breakdown of the consultancy charges, and only a lump sum \ufb01gure of the total consultancy charges may be quoted. Nevertheless, the working sheet must be kept as part of the internal records and may be subject to an internal audit as deemed necessary. The consultancy agreement must comply with the laws of India as per t he Standardized Terms and Conditions. However, in exceptional circumstances and with proper approvals, compliance with both local and international laws may be considered. The Principal Investigator (PI) is solely responsible for completing the project and delivering the agreed -upon deliverables. MIT-WPU only provides necessary support to the PI. After the completion of the project, the Principal Investigator (PI) shall provide a Final Project Completion Report (PCR) to the funding agency. Additionally, two copies of the report shall be submitted to the R&D Cell for record keeping. To ensure the project account can be closed by the Finance Department of MIT-WPU, it is important to obtain a Completion Certi\ufb01cate (CC) from the funding agency to con\ufb01rm the successful completion of the project. Testing and evaluation services can be provided to ful\ufb01ll the requirements of governmental and associated organizations, speci\ufb01c clients, and external educational institutions. MIT-WPU may provide Standardization and Calibration services in areas where the necessary facilities are available or can be expanded. It is recommended that these services be supported by regular calibration and standardization of the laboratory equipment used for these purposes. For signi\ufb01cant projects where the consultancy value exceeds Rs. 5 Lakhs (Rupees Five Lakhs only), payments may be accepted against agreed -upon milestones with appropriate prior approvals. However, for smaller projects or daily consultancy work, payments must be obtained in advance from the client(s). In exceptional situations where the assigned PI is unable to complete the consultancy work undertaken by MIT-WPU, MIT-WPU retains the authority to reassign the consultancy to another investigator. If completing the consultancy is deemed impossible or unfeasible by MIT-WPU, the Approver will address the matter with the client to close the project.

The project account will be handled by the faculty or principal investigator (PI), who will spend the funds as required. The institute's share should also be transferred. The requirement for a consultancy project/task/work can originate from the industry or other organizations concerned, or the faculty can approach the industry or other organizations. The faculty is expected to estimate the time and cost required to accompl ish the task. A proposal is then prepared by the principal investigator (PI). The budget for the proposal should be in one part and re\ufb02ect the project consultancy fee for the principal investigator (PI), co -PI, and other investigators, 50% overheads to MIT -WPU, and service tax on the total amount if applicable. Service tax is subject to periodic revision by the Government of India. Service tax is not applicable on projects if the funds are received in foreign currency. Expenses for equipment, supporting manpower, travel, and contingency must also be included in the budget, if necessary.

TESTING PROJECTS Testing refers to the process of assessing a component or product against established standards. This may include testing the strength of concrete in construction, soil compaction strength, pressure gauge calibration, and chemical identi\ufb01cation, drug ident i\ufb01cation, estimation, and evaluation of unknown species. MIT-WPU will undertake testing jobs if facilities are available, and if such testing does not interfere with any teaching or research work. Faculty may initiate testing jobs once a request is receive d. The overall procedure for operation of the testing project is similar to that of a consultancy project. GENERAL GUIDELINES Limitations: Involving Foreign Collaborators: Publications of Results: Performing regular testing tasks should be discouraged. Additionally, it is important to exercise caution and ensure that consultancy projects do not hinder the regular duties of faculty members. The proposals that involve foreign collaborators must comply with the National Laws, Rules, Regulations, and procedures in effect regarding funding support to each partner. Researchers who wish to publish technical or scienti\ufb01c papers based on the project 's research work should follow the sponsoring agency's guidelines and acknowledge the agency's assistance in the publications. If the research results are to be legally protected, the investigators should take necessary steps to secure legal protection for the research results before publishing them. External Consultants External consultants may be engaged to provide comprehensive services to clients, but their in Consul tancy Projects: Con\ufb02ict of Interest: Consultants: Exceptions: utilization will be limited. They will be entitled to receive a lump sum honorarium or fee, which should not exceed 30% of the total consultancy fee speci\ufb01ed in the Consultancy Projects Proposal. Consultants are required to disclose in writing to the Dean R&D any relationship they may have with the client funding the consultancy project or any vendor to whom payments are made from project funds, such as the involvement of immediate relatives, or any potential scope for dispro - portionate self -gain. A commi ttee will review such cases and advise the Dean R&D to ensure that there is no actual con\ufb02ict of interest, and that the consultant's involvement does not compromise their objectivity, integrity, or commitment to the Institute and the profession. Consultants are prohibited from using the name of the Institute or their af\ufb01liation with the Institute in a way that (i) implies that the Institute endorses or opposes a product or service provided by a pro\ufb01t, non- pro\ufb01t, or government entity, (ii) suggests that the Institute has conducted research or released research \ufb01ndings when it has not done so, or presents the results of Institute research in a misleading manner, or (iii) could be perceived as conveying the of\ufb01cial position of the Institute on any matter of public interest. Book royalty and honorarium for services like Expert Committee meetings, invited lectures, Ph.D. viva/evaluation, invited training programmes, organization of conferences/workshops are not considered part of the consultancy services. 43 C MIT-WPU RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 44 www.mitwpu.edu.in PREAMBLE MIT World Peace University, hereafter referred to as MIT-WPU/Institute, has been striving for the last 40 years to develop a pool of high -quality scienti\ufb01c and technical professionals and provide solutions to various challenging technological issues that may arise in different \ufb01elds. The Institute is supported by well - quali\ufb01ed faculty and highly skilled staff, committed to be coming a premier center of teaching, research, and extension in Engineering and Technology. The Institute fosters academic excellence, innovation, and encourages scholarship and research. The MIT World Peace University recognizes the value of intangible assets such as inventions, copyrights, know -how, designs, and other creative and innovative products resulting from the intellectual and scienti\ufb01c endeavors of its faculty and students, whic h provide a competitive advantage to the Institute. To provide guidance on the practices and rules regarding intellectual property rights (IPR), ownership, commercial exploitation, technology transfer, and con\ufb01dentiality requirements, the Institute has for mulated its intellectual property policy. The policy aims to create an environment conducive to curiosity -driven and market -driven research and development activities, as well as the creation of original works of authorship, for the bene\ufb01t of the Institute, its faculty, staff, students, research scholars, and external agencies. It should be emphasized that this IPR policy should be considered as a guide rather than a rigid regulation in the legal sense, given the constantly evolving landscape of the national IPR policy, and may be subject to modi\ufb01cations if necessary. This document, along with the accompanying addendum (Operating guidelines) and annexures (providing useful information on Patents and Copyright), is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the Intellectual Property (IP) management framework at MIT -WPU. PURPOSE The purpose of the IPR policy of MIT-WPU is to: The primary objective of MIT -WPU's intellectual property policy is to facilitate, encourage, promote and",

To provide guidance on the practices and rules regarding intellectual property rights (IPR), ownership, commercial exploitation, technology transfer, and con\ufb01dentiality requirements, the Institute has for mulated its intellectual property policy. The policy aims to create an environment conducive to curiosity -driven and market -driven research and development activities, as well as the creation of original works of authorship, for the bene\ufb01t of the Institute, its faculty, staff, students, research scholars, and external agencies. It should be emphasized that this IPR policy should be considered as a guide rather than a rigid regulation in the legal sense, given the constantly evolving landscape of the national IPR policy, and may be subject to modi\ufb01cations if necessary. This document, along with the accompanying addendum (Operating guidelines) and annexures (providing useful information on Patents and Copyright), is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the Intellectual Property (IP) management framework at MIT -WPU. PURPOSE The purpose of the IPR policy of MIT-WPU is to: The primary objective of MIT -WPU's intellectual property policy is to facilitate, encourage, promote and safeguard scienti\ufb01c inquiry, research pursuits and academic freedom of its faculty, researchers and students. The Institute aims to foster a culture of innovation that encourages the creation and development of intellectual property within its premises.; The policy aims to provide a clear understanding of the rights and responsibilities of the faculty, staff, and students regarding intellectual property and to protect the interests of the Institute and its members. One of the objectives of the MIT-WPU IPR policy is to establish a comprehensive management policy and procedural guidelines for converting the knowledge generated within the Institute to wealth. This involves the identi\ufb01cation, protection, management, and commercialization of intellectual property assets, such as patents, copyrights, and trademar ks, with the aim of generating income for the Institute and its members. The policy also includes guidelines for technology transfer, licensing agreements, and spin -off companies, as well as procedures for resolving disputes related to IPR. The primary objective of the IPR policy is to enable the Institute to make effective and bene\ufb01cial use of the intellectual property created by its members, in order to maximize the bene\ufb01ts to the inventors, the Institute, and the society as a whole. The aim is to establish the Institute as a leading academic research center that upholds the highest standards of scholarship and teaching. This can be achieved by disseminating the bene\ufb01ts of intellectual property generated at the Institute to the communi ty and society. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (POLICY AND GUIDELINES) OBJECTIVES The IPR policy of the Institute aims to: The Institute aims to protect and enhance the value of intellectual property created by its faculty, staff, and students during their tenure at the Institute. This will provide opportunities for wealth generation, alleviation of human suffering, and improvement of human life. The objective is to promote awareness and culture of IPR among the faculty, staff, and students of the Institute by implementing prudent IP management practices. Establish a centralized and comprehensive reference system to address all IPR related issues in a streamlined and ef\ufb01cient manner, making it easier for faculty, staff, and students to access infor mation and receive guidance. The IPR policy of the Institute aims to proactively create an environment that fosters the generation of new knowledge through research and innovations, while also aligning with the educational mission of the Institute. SCOPE This policy applies to all forms of intellectual property resulting from the intellectual and scienti\ufb01c pursuits of the following individuals: faculty members, staff, students, research scholars (both internal and external), individuals employed in sponsored research and consultancy projects, visiting scientists/professors/professionals who contribute to the teaching and research wor k conducted at the Institute, whether full -time or part -time, regardless of whether these rights are eligible for registration. The intellectual property generated from academic research encompasses patents, designs, copyright, know -how, and con\ufb01dential in formation. POLICY STATEMENT The Institute is dedicated to balancing the promotion, protection, management, and commercialization of intellectual property while also maintaining its core values of teaching, research, and community service. It acknowledg es the importance of commercializing and exploiting intellectual property for generating additional revenue for the Institute and offering bene\ufb01ts to its staff and students. However, the Institute also acknowledges the signi\ufb01cance of traditional academic v alues and expectations. DEFINITIONS Intellectual Property (IP) refers to intangible knowledge products and encompasses all types of results, conclusions, deductions, inventions, ideas, improvements, discoveries, enhancements, solutions, processes, modi\ufb01cations, know -how, data, and informatio n that are conceived, generated, made, or reduced to practice by the faculty, staff, students, research scholars, and other employees of the Institute. This includes designs, software programmes, genetically engineered microorganisms, business models, and copyrightable works that result from their intellectual output. IP is the result of research supported or sponsored by the Institute, industrial consulting, or other collaborative research and development efforts. Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) refers to the legal rights that are granted to individuals or entities for their creative and innovative works. These rights are derived from various forms of intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. IPR grants exclusive rights to the creators or owners of intellectual property, allowing them to contr ol the use, distribution, and commercialization of their creations. This ensures that they are able to bene\ufb01t \ufb01nancially from their work and encourages further innovation and creativity. Some examples of IPR include the following: Patents: These are legal protections granted to inventors for their new and useful inventions or discoveries. They give the inventor the exclusive right to manufacture, use, and sell the invention for a certain period. 45 C MIT-WPU RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 46 www.mitwpu.edu.in Trademarks: Copyrights: Trade Secrets: These are symbols, logos, or phrases used to identify and distinguish a particular product or service from others.

Trademarks protect the brand iden tity of a company or individual and prevent others from using similar marks that could confuse consumers. These are legal protections granted to authors, artists, and creators for their original works of expression, such as books, music, \ufb01lms, and software. Copyrights give the creator the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, and display their work. These are con\ufb01dential business information or practices that give a company a competitive advantage. Trade secret protection prevents others from using or disclosing secret information without permission. Overall, IPR plays a crucial role in protecting and incentivizing innovation and creativity by providing legal protections an d \ufb01nancial rewards for the creators and owners of intellectual property. Background information the term \"background information\" in a Collaborative Research and Development programme refers to the technical knowledge and expertise that is owned or controlled by the programme partners before the commencement of the programme. This information is typically in the same \ufb01eld as the programme's subject matter or in related \ufb01elds that are necessary for the successful execution of the programme. The term \"Institute Personnel\" as used in this policy document encompasses a wide range of individuals including but not limited to full-time and part -time faculty members, staff, students, research scholars (both internal and external), visiting scientists, professors, and other professionals who are employed or engaged by the institute. OWNERSHIP OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Whenever the Institute \ufb01les an application for ownership of intellectual property rights, it is require d to acknowledge and mention all individuals who have made signi\ufb01cant intellectual contributions to the creation or invention in question. These individuals must be identi\ufb01ed as inventors or creators in the application. Copyrights The ownership of copyright on all teaching and instructional materials created by employees of the Institute as part of any academic programmes or activities shall belong to the Institute. However, the author(s) of such materials shall retain the right to use the materials in their professional work. This clause does not apply to books, articles, monographs, speeches, and other works produced by the Institute staff members during research and teaching, using Institute resources. The Institute acknowledges and recognizes that the faculty members own the copyright to such traditional works of authorship. In situations where Institute employees have created copyrightable works, including software, using. signi\ufb01cant Institute resources, the Institute may require the employees to assign some or all of the copyright to such works. The extent to which the Institute's resources have been used to produce the copyrightable work will determine the extent of the assignment of the copyright. The Institute shall have ownership of the copyright of works created by non-Institute personnel who are engaged or associated with any Institute activity, regardless of whether Institute personnel have made intellectual contributions to such works or not. In cases where copyrightable works are created during sponsored or collaborative activities, the ownership of copyright shall be determined either in accordance with the terms and conditions related to intellectual property speci\ufb01ed in the contract governing such activity (if any), or through mutual consultations and agreement between the Institute and the sponsoring/collaborating agency. 47 www.mitwpu.edu.in In the case of a thesis, dissertation, or project report written by a student, the ownership of copyright shall be jointly held by the student and their guide. However, the Institute may demand the full assignment of the copyright in such cases. In cases where the Institute does not demand the assignment of copyright or where the copyright has not been assigned to the Institute, the Institute shall be entitled to a non -exclusive, non -transferable lic ense to use the work within the Institute for non-commercial educational and research purposes. Additionally, the Institute may possess a limited number of copies of the work for such purposes. Unless otherwise speci\ufb01ed in the original contract for the work, any copyrightable work that is generated as a work -for-hire shall normally belong to the Institute. If the Institute anticipates a potential \ufb01nancial gain from any copyrights, it may take steps to \ufb01le and protect such copyrights and share the result ing \ufb01nancial bene\ufb01ts with the creator(s) according to the terms and conditions established by the Institute. Institute - Supported Research All intellectual property rights arising from investigations conducted at the Institute using the Institute's resources shall belong to and be the exclusive property of the Institute, except in cases where such investigations are conduct - ed jointly with o ther institutions and agencies or are sponsored by an outside agency. Sponsored Research The intellectual property rights (IPR) of inventions resulting from research projects that are carried out on behalf of and fully funded by a sponsoring agency shall be registered jointly in the name of the Institute and the sponsoring agency if the cost of securing and maintaining the IPR registration is shared equally between the Institute and the sponsoring agency.

Institute - Supported Research All intellectual property rights arising from investigations conducted at the Institute using the Institute's resources shall belong to and be the exclusive property of the Institute, except in cases where such investigations are conduct - ed jointly with o ther institutions and agencies or are sponsored by an outside agency. Sponsored Research The intellectual property rights (IPR) of inventions resulting from research projects that are carried out on behalf of and fully funded by a sponsoring agency shall be registered jointly in the name of the Institute and the sponsoring agency if the cost of securing and maintaining the IPR registration is shared equally between the Institute and the sponsoring agency. However, if the sponsoring agency is not willing to share the costs of registration and maintenance, the IPR shall belong exclusively to the Institute. If the sponsoring agency is not willing to share the cost of securing and maintaining the IPR registration for jointly \ufb01led applications, the Institute may, at its discretion, \ufb01le the application with sole ownership and bear the entire cost of securing and protecting the IPR. In cases where the research project is only partially funded by the sponsoring agency or if there are multiple sponsors for the same project, the sharing of IPR shall be determined through mutual consultations and appropriate agreements between the Institute and the sponsoring agency(ies). If the sponsoring agency is an industry, they may choose one of the following options for sharing the IPR with the Institute: The Institute may enter into an agreement with the sponsoring industry where the ownership of IPR will rest with the industry. However, the industry will have to pay the Institute an initial lump sum and reasonable annual royalties for a speci\ufb01c period as recognition of the Institute's contribution to the project. The terms of ownership of the IPR will be governed by a speci\ufb01c prior agreement between the Institute and the sponsoring industry. The ownership of IPR rested in the sponsoring industry may be exclusive or non -exclusive. In case of exclusive ownership, if the industrial sponsor fails to exploit within a mutually agreed time limit, the Institute may permit third -party exploitation of the IPR. The Institute shall retain ownership of the IPR, but the industrial sponsor shall have the right to exploit the IPR either exclusively or non-exclusively. This right will be granted in exchang e for an initial lump sum payment, subsequent annual royalties for a speci\ufb01ed period, or other bene\ufb01ts to the Institute as mutually agreed upon. In cases of exclusive exploitation rights, if the industrial sponsor fails to exploit the IPR within an agreed -upon time limit, third -party exploitation may be permitted. The Institute shall retain user rights for the purposes of further research and development. The terms of ownership and exploitation rights will be governed by a speci\ufb01c prior agreement between the Institute and the sponsoring industry. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 Joint Research In the case of intellectual property resulting from joint research conducted by Institute personnel with external organizations/agencies/individuals, the ownership of the IP will be jointly shared by the Institute and the collaborators. The cost of \ufb01ling a nd maintaining the IPR as well as the revenue generated from its commercial exploitation will be shared by both parties according to an agreed -upon formula. If the collaborators do not agree to share the cost, the Institute may decide at its discretion to \ufb01le and maintain the IPR at its own expense. In such cases, the sharing of revenue resulting from the commercial exploitation of the IPR will be determined solely by the Institute. Technology Transfer The Institute will make all efforts to commercially exploit the IPR obtained, either solely or jointly with other agencies, to the fullest extent reasonably possible and without unnecessary delay. The marketing of the IPR will be conducted through technology transfer agreements, licensing (both exclusive and non-exclusive), and revenue -sharing models. The Institute will attempt to \ufb01nd potential licensees to commercially exploit the intellectual property (IP) that it owns outright. If the IP is jointly owned, the Institute will offer the \ufb01rst opportunity to commercially exploit it to the joint owners, regardless of whether the IP is protected by patents or not. This licensing agreement would require a lump sum payment as a technology transfer fee, as well as ongoing royalty payments for an agreed -upon period from the start of commercial exploitation. If the joint owner declines this option, the Institute will move forward with commercializing the IP in a manner it sees \ufb01t. If the other collaborating organization or industry does not undertake commercial exploitation within two years from the initial development of the technology, the Institute retains the right to license the use of the intellectual property to a third party. The Institute may support entrepreneurial activities among its staff by transferring ownership of an intellectual property to the inventor(s) or creator(s) of the property, through an agreement. This will enable the staff member s to market, protect, and license the intellectual property independently, with minimal involvement from the Institute. The Institute requires the assignee to pay all expenses related to patenting and licensing, as well as any royalties, equity, or other value received by the inventor(s) or creator(s). The Institute would make efforts to commercialize intellectual property, either through its own means or by hiring a Technology Management Agency to develop the IP created by its staff.

After a speci\ufb01ed period, the inventor(s) or creator(s) may request that the Institute transfer the rights to them. Revenue Sharing The sole applicant for any intellectual property (IP) generated at MIT-WPU will be the institute itself, and no sharing of revenue will occur, even if the IP is commercialized. However, in cases where the institute chooses to transfer the IP rights to the inventor(s)/creator(s), the inventor(s)/creator(s) will be required to reimburse the institute for all costs incurred in protecting, maintaining, marketing, and otherwise associated with the IP. 48 C MIT-WPU 49 www.mitwpu.edu.in Infringements, Damages, Liability, and Indemnity Insurance As a policy, the Institute will require any licensee to provide indemni\ufb01cation against any legal proceedings, including but not limited to those arising from manufacturing defects, production problems, design guarantees, and obligations related to upgrades and debugging, in any contract between the licensee and the Institute. The Institute will include an indemnity clause in agreements with licensees when transferring technology or copyrighted material, to protect its personne l. The Institute will also retain the right to decide whether or not to engage in any litigation concerning patents and license infringements. Conflict of Interest Inventors must disclose any con\ufb02icts of interest or potential con\ufb02icts of interest. If the inventor(s) or their immediate family have a stake in a licensee or potential licensee company, they must disclose the stake they or their immediate family have in the company. In the case of a license or an assignment of rights for a patent to a company where the inventor(s) have a stake, the approval of the IPR Cell will be required. Dispute Resolution If there are any disputes between the Institute and the inventors concerning the implementation of the IP policy, the aggrieved party can appeal to the Vice Chancellor of the Institute. The Institute will make efforts to address the concerns of the aggrieved party. However, the decision of the Chancellor will be \ufb01nal and binding in this matter. APPLICATION OF POLICY This policy is considered a part of the conditions of employment for every employee of the Institute, as well as a condition of enrollment and attendance for students at the Institute. The policy applies to all existing staff and students upon enrollment. Bottom of Form The Institute retains the right to amend the IPR Policy as necessary or deemed appropriate. All potential cre ators who use Institute -sponsored resources or participate in a sponsored research project must comply with this policy and accept the principles of intellectual property ownership outlined in this policy, unless an exception is approved in writing by the Institute. RIGHT TO REGULATE POLICY The IPR Cell is responsible for interpreting the policy, resolving disputes, and applying the policy. The cell may also recommend changes to the policy p eriodically to the Registrar and Vice Chancellor, who will make decisions on any suggested changes. The IPR policy may be reviewed every three years, or earlier if there is a signi\ufb01cant change in the national policy. LEGAL JURISDICTION As a policy, all ag reements signed by the Institute and any resulting disputes will be subject to the legal jurisdiction of the Court of Adjudication in Pune only. These agreements will be governed by the appropriate laws of India.

IP PROTECTION -SOME EXPLANATORY NOTES (To be read in conjunction with MIT-WPU IPR\u2013Annexure: some useful information on patents and copyright) Intellectual property can take various forms such as patents, industrial designs, trademarks, copyrights, con\ufb01dential information, technical know -how, mask works, processes, plans, speci\ufb01cations, guidelines, graphics, training materials, softwa re programmes, records, drawings, instruction guides, student materials, new techniques, algorithms, concepts, and more. To be protected by MIT World Peace University, the intangible product of the intellect must have potential for industrial application o r for enhancing the S&T knowledge base. A patent can be awarded for any invention that is capable of being commercially applied. To meet the patentability standards, the invention must satisfy the criteria of novelty, utility, and non -obviousness. Addition ally, there must be an inventive step, which refers to an innovation that is not apparent to a person with ordinary skill in the relevant \ufb01eld. The invention may pertain to a new product, an improvement to an existing product, or a new process of manufacturing an existing or new product. Design protection can be obtained for any prototype that in\ufb02uences the consumer's choice by appealing to their aesthetic sense. In simpler terms, design protection can be secured for the appearance, visual features, and overall look of the article. However, design protection is not available for functional features. Patents are intended to safeguard applied and extension research, while copyright law is designed to protect pure or fundamental research.

PROCEDURE FOR IP PROTECTION All patent and copyright applications (as per profo rma MIT -WPU/IPR -01 and MIT -WPU/IPR -02, respectively) must be sent to the Convener/Dean R&D through the IPR Cell via the Dean of the School or Director of the Center, regardless of whether the inventions have resulted from in - house projects or sponsored projects. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 52 MIT-WPU C RECORD KEEPING PROCEDURES All data and details produced by a creator during the creation of intellectual property should be meticulously documented in the relevant School/Centre, with speci\ufb01c emphasis on the following: Avoid using abbreviations or technical terms that are not commonly understood, unless they are explained in a table at the beginning or end of the book. This will ensure that readers who are not familiar with the terminology can understand the text without confusion or dif\ufb01culty. Important information such as data, descriptions, or experiments that pertain to signi\ufb01cant inventions or discoveries should be attributed and documented by the individual(s) responsible for the project, such as the creator, supervisor, or coordinator. I. Any changes that need to be made should be indicated by crossing out the deleted content and labeling it as \"cancelled\". The corrected data, clearly marked as such, should be entered immediately below and authenticated by the creator with their initials an d the date. II. In cases where new products are created or produced by a new method, it is advisable to preserve samples and take photographs for record keeping purposes. All photographs should be dated and signed by the creator on the back. When Should Faculty Approach IPR Cell To Discuss a Possible Patent? MIT-WPU has established an exclusive IPR Cell to manage intellectual property rights. Faculty members who have created potential intellectual property while employed by MIT-WPU can approach the IPR Cell advisor to arrange a discussion at a mutually convenient time. It is recommended that this discussion occurs well in advance of the idea maturing into a process or product. If the invention is only in the conception stage, it is possible to \ufb01le a provisional speci\ufb01cation, which must be followed up with a complete speci\ufb01cation within 12 months; otherwise, the patent application will be considered abandoned. However, if the inventor has an innovative product that can be immediately marketed, a complete speci\ufb01cation can be lod ged right away. EVALUATION OF PATENT/COPYRIGHT APPLICATIONS The IPR Cell will receive and examine each patent/copyright application submitted through an Invention Disclosure Form/Copyright Disclosure form according to the MIT-WPU/IPR -01/MIT -WPU/IPR -02 proforma. Additionally, an IPR facilitation request (MIT -WPU/IPR -03) must be included. The committee may request assistance from other professors who are experts in the relevant \ufb01eld to conduct an initial evaluation of proposals for their potential patentability. These domain experts will be required to sign a non-Disclosure agreement according to the MIT -WPU/IPR -04 proforma and a No Con\ufb02ict -of-Interest Form according to the MIT -WPU/IPR -05 profor ma before being granted access to the proposal. If necessary, the inventors may be asked to present their case before the IPR Cell. If the Cell recommends \ufb01ling for patents, the Convener of the IPR Cell will facilitate the application through one of the a pproved attorneys from the panel maintained by the IPR Cell. ASSISTANCE IN FILLING THE PROFORMA Once the IPR Cell approves protecting the Intellectual output, a patent Attorney shall be identi\ufb01ed by the Cell for drafting the IP application. The following aspects need to receive attention: Objective of the invention: What problem is the inventor trying to solve? What are the issues involved? The objective of the invention should clearly state the problem that the inventor is trying to solve. This should be a concise statement that identi\ufb01es the issues involved in the invention. For example, the objective of the invention might be to develop a more ef\ufb01cient method for processing data or to create a new device that solves a speci\ufb01c problem in a particular industry. 53 www.mitwpu.edu.in What prior art searches have been made?

Who are responsible for administration of IPRs in the country? The Controller General of Patents, Designs, and Trademarks is responsible for overseeing patents, designs, and trademarks. This department operates under the Ministry of Industry's Department of Industrial Development. Copyright, on the other hand, falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Human Resource Development. 4. What is a patent? A patent is a legal monopoly which is granted for a limited time to the owner of an invention. Patent rights A patent is a legal right granted by the state that provides a limited -time monopoly to the owner of an invention. Simply possessing a patent does not automatically give the owner the right to use or exploit the patented invention; other laws and regulations, such as those governing health and safety, food and drugs, and inheritance, may also affect these rights. Patent rights can be sold, licensed, inherited, abandoned, and may even be subject to revocation by the state in certain circumstances, both before and aft er the grant of the patent. Additionally, there are global patents available for international protection. 55 www.mitwpu.edu.in 5. What is the distinction between patented invention and know -how? According to the law, a patent speci\ufb01cation does not have to disclose all the information required for the commercial exploitation of the invention. Therefore, the information provided in a patent speci\ufb01cation may not be suf\ufb01cient for commercialization purposes. In contrast, known -how refers to all the information necessary for commercializing an invention, such as details of production methods and design drawings needed to set up a production plant. If known -how is developed around an existing patent and subsequently commercialized without the patentee's agreement, it may be considered an infringement of the patent unless the patentee has agreed to such commercialization on mutually. Agreed terms. 6. How is an invention interpreted? For an invention to be considered patentable, it must not only be novel, but also involve an inventive step. This means that the invention must not be obvious to a person skilled in the relevant \ufb01eld, taking into consideration the state of the art, but disregarding unpublished pending patent applications. However, simplicity is not necessarily a barrier to securing a patent. The means of achieving the desired outcome may be simple and common, but an inventive step may still exist if the inventor has developed a variant that produces more useful results. It does not matter whether the invention was developed by accident, as long as it involves some level of inventive step. Whether or not it has been in the meantime sold or licensed. There is no such thing as What are patentable inventions under the patent Act, 1970? Invention means any new and useful: Art, process, method, or manner of manufacture Machines, apparatus, or another article Substances produced by manufacture and included any new and useful improvements of any of them and an alleged invention. However, inventions claiming substances intended for use; or capable of being used, as food or as medicine of drug or relating to subst ances prepared or produced by chemical processes (including alloys, optical glass, semi -conductors, and inter -metallic compounds) are not patentable. 7. How is the novelty of and invention determined? The novelty of an invention is determined based on the knowledge that is available globally, including in India, at the time of \ufb01ling the patent application. This means that the invention should not have been known or disclosed to the public anywhere in the world before the \ufb01ling date of the patent application . 8. What are the types of inventions which are not patentable? An invention which is frivolous, or which claims anything obviously contrary to well established natural laws e.g., different types of perpetual motion or machines which violate the third law of thermodynamics. An invention that has a primary or intended use which is contrary to law or morality or injurious to public health is not considered patentable. For example, a process for preparing a beverage that involves the use of a carcinogenic substance, even if the beverage has a higher nourishment value, would not be considered patentable. The mere discovery of a scienti\ufb01c principle or the form ulation of an abstract theory is not patentable. For example, the discovery of the Raman Effect, which is a scienti\ufb01c principle, cannot be patented. However, an invention that makes use of scienti\ufb01c principle or theory can be patented if it meets the criteria of novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability. To be patentable, the invention must involve an inventive step. Thus, the mere discovery of any new property or",

Thus, the mere discovery of any new property or new use of a known substance or the mere use of a known process, machine or apparatus is not considered patentable, unless such a known process results in a new product or employs at least one new reactant. In other words, there must be some degree of i nnovation and improvement in the known substance or process to be eligible for a patent. A substance that is created by simply mixing existing substances together, resulting only in the combination of their properties, is not patentable. The same applies to a process for creating such a substance. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 56 MIT-WPU C The mere arrangement, rearrangement, or duplication of features of known devices, each functioning independently of one another in a known way, is not considered an invention and hence not patentable. In other words, a patent cannot be granted for a combin ation of known features that does not result in any new or improved function or technical effect. A method or process of testing applicable during the process of manufacture for rendering the machine, apparatus, or other equipment more ef\ufb01cient. A method of agriculture or horticulture. Any process for medicinal, surgical, curative, prophylactic or other treatment of human \u2018beings, or any process for a simila r treatment of animals or plants. Invention relating to atomic energy. 9. When should an application for a patent be \ufb01led? a) It is important to \ufb01le a patent application as soon as possible, rather than waiting until the invention is fully developed for commercial use. Filing an application with a provisional speci\ufb01cation can help establish priority for the applicant. Delay in \ufb01ling an application can lead to risks such as other inventors applying for a patent for the same invention before the \ufb01rst inventor, or inadvertent publica tion of the invention by the inventor or others independently. What are the essential patent documents to be generated and submitted by a potential patentee? b) There are two types of patent documents usually known as patent speci\ufb01cation namely. Provisional speci\ufb01cation Complete speci\ufb01cation PROVISIONAL SPECIFICATION To add to the previous answer, a complete speci\ufb01cation is a detailed description of the invention and how to make and use it. It should include claims that de\ufb01ne the scope of the invention for which protection is sought. The claims must be clear, concise, and supported by the description. The complete speci\ufb01cation must be \ufb01led within 12 months from the date of \ufb01ling the provisional speci\ufb01cation, and failure to do so will result in the abandonment of the application. It's also worth noting that while a provisional speci\ufb01cation may be \ufb01led without any claims, the complete speci\ufb01cation must include at least one claim de\ufb01ning the scope of the invention. The claims must be carefully drafted to ensure that they are not overly broad or vague, which could result in the patent being challenged or invalidated later. The provisional speci\ufb01cation is not a permanent and independent scienti\ufb01c cum legal document. It is a temporary document \ufb01led to establish priority of the invention and to secure a \ufb01ling date. Amendments to the provisional speci\ufb01cation can be made at any time before \ufb01ling a complete speci\ufb01cation. However, once a complete speci\ufb01cation is \ufb01led, amendments to the provisional speci\ufb01cation are not allowed. COMPLETE SPECIFICATION To obtain a patent, it is necessary to submit a Complete Speci\ufb01cation. This speci\ufb01cation should include informa - tion about the \ufb01eld to which the invention relates, the background of the prior art, any drawbacks related to the previously known details of the invention, the best way of carrying out the invention, and claims that de\ufb01ne the scope of the invention. The Complete Speci\ufb01cation should provide enough information to enable a person skilled in the art to work on the invention without requiring assistance from the inventor. 57 www.mitwpu.edu.in 10. What are the criteria for naming inventors(s) in an application for patent? The naming of inventors is normally decided based on the following criteria: All persons who have contributed towards the conception or reduction to practice of at least one claim of the invention should be named as an inventor. Intellectual contribution towards the results of the research work leading to a patent is not suf\ufb01cient for being named as an inventor. Contribution towards the conception or reduction to practice of at least one claim of the invention is necessary. A person who has not contributed to the conception or reduction to practice of at least one claim of the invention is not entitled to be included as an inventor. A person who provides only routine assistance, such as making dr awings or constructing a prototype under the direction of an inventor, is not entitled to be named as an inventor. Dif\ufb01culties may arise in determining who should be named as an inventor, and to avoid such situations,",

Dif\ufb01culties may arise in determining who should be named as an inventor, and to avoid such situations, it is important for all researchers to maintain clear and accurate records of their work in a consecutively numbered diary, with entries signed by both the researchers and their team leader. 11. Can a published or disclosed invention be patented? To clarify, if an inventor publicly discloses their invention before \ufb01ling a patent application, it could potentially prevent them from obtaining a patent. This is because one of the requirements for obtaining a patent is that the invention must be new and non -obvious at the time the patent application is \ufb01led. If the invention has already been publi cly disclosed, it may no longer meet the novelty requirement. Therefore, it is generally recommended that inventors do not disclose their inventions publicly before \ufb01ling a patent application. Instead, they should keep their invention con\ufb01dential and \ufb01le a patent application as soon as possible. If an inventor does choose to disclose their invention before \ufb01ling a patent application, they may still be able to obtain a patent if they \ufb01le the application within a certain time frame. In the United States, for example, inventors have one year from the date of the \ufb01rst public disclosure to \ufb01le a patent application. If an inventor does obtain a patent, they should include the patent number and date in any subsequent publications or disclosures related to the invention. This provides information to the public about the existence of the patent and its scope of protection. 12. What is considered the date of patent? The date on which the complete speci\ufb01cation is \ufb01led is considered the date of patent, and it is a crucial date for determining the legal protection of the invention covered by the patent. The term of the patent is calculated from this date, and it is from this date that the exclusive rights of the patent holder begin. 13. What is the term of a patent in Indian system? The term of every patent in India is 20 years, starting from the date of \ufb01ling of the patent application, regardless of whether it was \ufb01led with a provisional or complete speci\ufb01cation. However, for applications \ufb01led under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), the term of 20 years begins from the international \ufb01ling date. 14. How does one keep a patent in force for the full patent terms? To maintain a patent's validity, the patent holder is required to pay renewal fees at regular intervals. If the renewal fees are not paid, the patent will expire and will no longer be legally enforceable. Once a patent has expired, the invention becomes open to the public, and anyone can use, manufacture or sell the invention without permission from the original patent holder. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 58 MIT-WPU C 15. What is expected from a patentee? As per Indian patent law, it is expected that a patent holder should work their invention in India on a commercial scale and without any unnecessary delay. A patent is not granted simply to provide a monopoly to the patent holder for importing the patented product into India. This means that a patent holder ca nnot simply hold onto their invention and prevent others from using it. The intention behind granting a patent is to promote innovation and encourage the progress of technology, and to ensure that the invention is being utilized for the bene\ufb01t of society. 16. What is the nature of the information needed while consulting a patent attorney? When working with a patent agent or attorney to \ufb01le a patent application, it is important to provide them with a clear and comprehensive explanation of the invention. This may include information about the history of the invention, including where the idea came from and how it was developed. Any early failures or prototypes may also be relevant to understanding the inventive step involved in the invention. It is important to highlight what you believe to be the most central and inventive aspect of the invention, as well as any similar prior inventions that may exist. If you have developed an improved version of a competitor's product, it is important to disclose this information to the patent agent. Honesty and transparency in these matters will help the patent agent to draft claims and speci \ufb01cations that accurately re\ufb02ect the invention and avoid any potential for excessive claims that could be rejected. By providing your patent agent with a comprehensive understanding of your invention, including its history, inventive elements, and any prio r inventions or improvements, they will be better equipped to draft a strong patent application that maximizes the protection of your invention. In order to \ufb01le a strong patent application, it is important to provide a detailed description of how the inve ntion can be practically used, as well as any test results or trials conducted",

This includes any failures or defects encountered during testing, as well as any alternative ways of using the invention or potential substitutes for its parts. It may be worthwhile to draft the patent application in such a way that it covers a broad range of alternatives, including less satisfactory options, to prevent competitors from marketing subpar products that could tarnish the reputation of the entire product genre. During the patent application process, it is import ant to respond quickly and accurately to any queries from the patent agent. This will help to keep the application on track and save time and money. As the inventor, it is also important to keep the patent agent informed of any new developments or improvem ents made to the invention, as well as any new competitors that may arise. This will help the patent agent to draft a strong and effective patent application that accurately re\ufb02ects the invention and provides maximum protection. 59 www.mitwpu.edu.in 17.

To communicate the sound recording to the public Explanation: For the purpose of this section, a copy which has been sold once shall be deemed to be a copy already in circulation. 19. How is a computer de\ufb01ned for the purpose of copyright? Computers include any electronic or similar device having information processing capabilities. 20. What is the de\ufb01nition of a computer programme? A computer programme refers to a sequence of instructions, expressed in various forms such as words, codes, schemes or other formats, that enables a computer to perform a speci\ufb01c task or achieve a particular result. This sequence of instructions may be stored on a machine -readable medium, such as a hard drive, USB drive or other similar storage device, and can be executed by a computer processor to perform various functions or tasks. In essence, a computer programme is a collection of instructions that a computer can follow to perform a speci\ufb01c task or series of tasks. 21. What is the term of a copyright? The term of copyright protection for a literary work published during the author's lifetime is the life of the author plus 60 years. This means that the copyright protection lasts for the entire lifetime of the author and for 60 years after their death. The term of copyright protection for cinematographic \ufb01lms, records, photographs, posthumous publications, anonymous publications, works of government, and international agencies is 60 years from the beginning of the calendar year following the year in which the work was published. This means that copyright protection lasts for 60 years from the year after the publication year. The term of copyright protection for broadcasting is 25 years from the beginning of the calendar year following the year in which the broadcast was made. This means that copyright protection lasts for 25 years from the year after the year in which the broadcast was made. 61 www.mitwpu.edu.in IPR POLICY IPR is a general term covering patents, registered design, trademarks, copyright, and layout design of integrated circuits, trade secrets, geographical indicators, and anti-competitive practices in contractual licenses. The Intellectual Property could be protected in the form of: Patent (to be registered) , Design Registrations (to be registered) , Trademark (registered or otherwise) , Copyright refers to the legal protection granted to the creators of original works of authorship, such as literary, artistic, and musical works, in various forms including registered or unregistered. In the context of the Institute, it may include plans, speci\ufb01cations, guidelines, graphics, training materials, software programmes, records, drawings, instruction guides, student materials, new techniques, algorithms, concepts, and other forms of creative expression. Con\ufb01dential information and technical know -how may also be protected under copy right law if they are embodied in original works of authorship. Mask works, which are designs used to create semiconductor chips, may also be protected under copyright law. Additionally, copyright protection may extend to the processes used to create works of authorship, such as the techniques used to produce a particular type of artwork or the algorithms used to generate computer programmes. Intellectual Property (IP) refers to intangible creations of the mind, such as inventions, ideas, designs, software programmes, and other forms of knowledge. It includes all results, conclusions, deductions, improvements, discoveries, solutions, processes, modi\ufb01cations, data, and information generated or produced by the faculty, staff, students, research scholars, and other employees of the Institute. IP is the result of research activities supported or sponsored by the Institute, industrial consulting, or other forms of joint research and development work. The ownership of IP resulting from such activities is determined by the Institute's IP policy. A patent application accompanied by a provisional application does not provide legal rights to the applicants. However, it is a crucial document that establishes the earliest ownership of an invention. This can be important in cases where multiple parties claim ownership of an invention. The provisional application establishes the priority date of the invention, which can be crucial in determining who has the right to \ufb01le a patent application \ufb01rst. SALIENT FEATURES OF IPR AND SERVICES PROVIDED BY IPR CELL RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 MIT-WPU C EXCEPTIONS FOR PATENT: To clarify, inventions that claim substances that are intended for use as food, medicine, or drugs, or that are capable of being used as such, are not patentable. Similarly, inventions that relate to substances that are prepared or produced by chemical processes, including alloys, optical glass, semi -conductors, and inter -metallic compounds, are also not patentable. WHETHER PATENT CAN BE REVOKED: Since a patent is granted by the state, it can also be revoked by the state under certain circumstances, even after it has been granted. It's important to note that a patent can be revoked by the state regardless of whether it has been sold or licensed in the meantime. CONTEST/CONFLICT WITH SPONSORING AGENCY: If the sponsoring agency does not cooperate in \ufb01ling a joint intellectual property rights (IPR) application, the Institute may choose to \ufb01le the application on its own with complete ownership and will bear all costs associated with securing and protecting the IPR. Copyright law protects pure or basic research, whereas patents seek to protect applied and extended research. If the intellectual property results from joint research carried out by Institute personnel and external organizations/ agencies/individuals, the ownership of the IP will be shared jointly by the Institute and the collaborators. In such cases, the Institut e will have the \ufb01rst right to commercially exploit the joint IP, regardless of whether it has been formally protected by patent(s) or not. IP COUNSELLING: The IPR cell will provide guidance and support to potential inventors of intellectual products and will assist the Institute in identifying the potential for IPR. If the cell recommends \ufb01ling for patents, the Convener/Dean R&D through the IPR cell will process the application through an approved attorney from the panel maintained by the IPR cell.

If any copyrightable work is created during sponsored or collaborative activities, ownership of the copyright will be determined by the terms and conditions outlined in the relevant contract or through mutual agreement with the sponsoring/collaborating agency. All faculty members, staff, students, research scholars (internal and external), visiting scientists, professors, and other professionals, whether full-time or part -time, can avail themselves of the services provided by the IPR cell. MIT -WPU has established sy stems and mechanisms to facilitate the commercial exploitation of the knowledge generated at the Institute under the provisions of the IPR regime in the country. SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE IPR CELL: It is crucial to respond promptly and accurately to queries from the patent agent both during the initial search and throughout the patent application process. This will facilitate the progress of the patent application and potentially save money. The IPR cell will periodically suggest patentable technologi es to potential licensing agencies, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), and other \ufb01nancial institutions, encouraging them to invest in venture capital for new technologies. 63 www.mitwpu.edu.in Is it possible to utilize the services of MIT -WPU IPR Cell to apply for a patent and get it granted? Certainly, I understand. The IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) Cell at MIT -WPU is responsible for assisting faculty members, research associates, research scholars, students, and other researchers working at MIT -WPU in obtaining patents for their inventio ns. In what proportion would the expenditure to be incurred for getting the patent granted be shared between MIT -WPU and the inventors? To clarify, if an inventor processes their patent application through MIT-WPU IPR Cell and MIT-WPU is designated as the assignee for the granted patent, then MIT-WPU is responsible for paying the fees associated with the various stages of the patent application process. In this case, the inventor is not required to pay any fees. If the expenditure to be incurred for the patenting process is fully borne by MIT-WPU, what will be royalty share for inventors after the patent is granted and we go for commercialization? As MIT-WPU is the sole applicant, there is no revenue sharing model, even for commercialized patents. Can you help us with the complete rules and regulations of the patent application and regulations followed by the MIT -WPU IPR Cell? Please go through the links \u2018frequently asked questions\u2019 and \u2018IPR Policy\u2019 under \u201cIPR Cell\u201d link at MIT-WPU Website. Is it possible to apply for a patent as an individual without help from MIT -WPU? To put it another way, if the invention is the result of work conducted by a researcher during their time at MIT-WPU and if the facilities provided by MIT -WPU were utilized in the creation of the invention, then it is expected that the inventor will \ufb01le their patent application through the MIT -WPU IPR Cell and designate MIT -WPU as the assignee. If the patent application is not processed through MIT -WPU IPR Cell, will MIT -WPU still \ufb01nancially support the patenting process? To rephrase, if the inventor chooses not to apply for a patent through the MIT-WPU IPR Cell, then MIT-WPU will not assume any responsibility for the costs associated with the patenting process. What is the documentation to be submitted to IPR Cell and what is the mode of submission, when one makes a beginning with patenting his invention? The Inventor is required to submit their proposal in the format of an Invention Disclosure Form (IDF) when making their proposal. It's important to note that the format of the IDF differs depending on whether it is for a patent or a design registration. The blank IDF for patent or design registration can be downloaded from the IPR Cell link on the MIT -WPU website. It's worth noting that there have been instances where Inventors have submitted Forms 1, 2, 3, and 5 of the Indian Patents Act 1970 as part of their proposal. However, it's important to remember that these forms are not required to be submitted to the IPR Cell. Instead, only the IDF is necessary for submitting the proposal. If the proposal is for a design registration, the Inventors must enter into an \"Agreement on Designs\" with MIT -WPU on a non -judicial stamp paper worth Rs. 20. A template for the agreement can be downloaded from the IPR Cell link on the MIT -WPU website. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ) RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 MIT-WPU C Which are the points which need particular attention, while \ufb01lling in the Invention Disclosure Form (IDF) for patents? The following points in IDF require particular attention: Point 8: General area of the patent: Please be speci\ufb01c.

The policy encompasses all forms of research that involve human participants, their tissues, or data, and should also be applied more broadly to activities such as enterprise and innovation, or service evaluation and audit, where ethical issues may arise. These policies are applicable to all research conducted by MIT-WPU's faculty and students. For studies that have obtained external ethical approval, there is no need to repeat the process. The appropriate University Ethics Committee must be informed and provided with a copy of the approval. The Ethics Committee will con\ufb01rm that no additional approval is necessary for the study. This policy is applicable to all individuals conducting research either within the University or on behalf of it. This includes staff, individuals with honorary University appointments, visiting researchers, undergraduate and postgraduate students, as well as visiting scholars and students. When a research project is being carried out by academics from multiple institutions, the lead institution (usually the institution where the Principal Investigator is employed) should seek the relevant ethical clearance for the project, and other partner institutions should be informed of any outcomes and issues. PURPOSE The aim of this policy and procedure is to establish and promote the highest ethical standards in academic research. The University is dedicated to safeguarding the rights, dignity, safety, and privacy of research subjects, as well as the well -being of animals, and ensuring environmental protection. Additionally, the University is committed to minimizing health and safety risks for researchers and upholding their academic freedom. The Institutional Ethics Committee of MIT-WPU will evaluate and approve all research proposals involving human participants, taking into account the welfare and safety of actual and potential research participants. The goals of research, no matter how important, should never be prioritized over the health and well -being of the research subjects. GUIDELINES Researchers af\ufb01liated with MIT-WPU must seek approval from the Ethics Committee. The ethical review process should ensure adherence to the following policy documents of MIT-WPU. a. Policy for Promotion of Research b. Plagiarism Policy c. Patent Policy d. Consultancy Policy ETHICS COMMITTEE 77 www.mitwpu.edu.in The University mandates an ethical review of all research projects that involve primary research with human subjects (or their data), regardless of funding source. In most cases, a review would be conducted by a Research Ethics Committee. Projects involving living persons, human tissues, or data related to recently deceased persons, as well as projects involving animals (including animals living in their natural habitats), must have genuine research, educational, or training purpose. Ethical approval is required for all research involving human participants, human material, or human data. Howe ver, research that uses information about human participants that is publicly and lawfully available, such as census data, population statistics, court reports, and personal letters or diaries in public libraries, is exempt from this requirement. The University has a Code of Ethics for Research that includes funda mental principles to protect human participants. The University requires that all research falling under this policy must adhere to the Code of Ethics and its fundamental principles. The University's policies,",

Projects involving living persons, human tissues, or data related to recently deceased persons, as well as projects involving animals (including animals living in their natural habitats), must have genuine research, educational, or training purpose. Ethical approval is required for all research involving human participants, human material, or human data. Howe ver, research that uses information about human participants that is publicly and lawfully available, such as census data, population statistics, court reports, and personal letters or diaries in public libraries, is exempt from this requirement. The University has a Code of Ethics for Research that includes funda mental principles to protect human participants. The University requires that all research falling under this policy must adhere to the Code of Ethics and its fundamental principles. The University's policies, committees, and sub -committees must consider the relevant professional ethical codes and research sponsor policies. If there is a difference in ethical standards between the University policy and the relevant professional body or research sponsor, the committees should apply the highest standard of ethical practice. Research ethics committees should be appropriate to the disciplinary mix of research they will review, comply with speci\ufb01c funding or professional body requirements, and comply with relevant legislative requirements. They should also consider the anticipated volume of work. Every research ethics committee should not only take the responsibility of reviewing and approving all research within its jurisdiction but also create and endorse research ethics toolkits. These toolkits should include standard consent forms, participant information sheets, and protocols for ensuring security, con\ufb01dentiality, anonymization, and retention o f data. It is essential for all research ethics committees to maintain detailed records of their proceedings and decisions. RESEARCH MANUAL 2023 -24 MIT-WPU C APPLICATION AND APPEALS PROCEDURE APPLICATIONS FOR ETHICAL APPROVAL The Institutional Research Ethics Board ethical committee will consider the following matters when reviewing applications for ethical approval, considering their relevance to the research project: The risk of physical, emotional, or reputational harm to research participants, and the steps that will be taken to minimize or mitigate these risks. The risk of physical or emotional harm to the researcher, and the steps that will be taken to minimize or mitigate these risks. The procedures for recruiting research participants and obtaining their informed consent, including the provision of participant information sheets and consent forms. The rationale for using observation or covert surveillance, or any other methods that may not be transparent to research participants. The measures that will be taken to ensure the security and con\ufb01dentiality of personal data and any human tissues or artefacts collected for the project, particularly those that will be stored or processed off-site. The arrangements for the retention, anonymization, and disposal of personal data, artefacts, or tissues at the end of the project, or as required by research sponsors or legal provisions. The procedures for debrie\ufb01ng research participants, particularly in cases where the research may have caused them distress. The procedures for reporting and dealing with any adverse reactions to the research project. The measures that will be taken to ensure that appropriate Ethical Board checks are conducted when researchers are working in settings where children or vulnerable adults may be present. If ethical approval is not granted or if signi\ufb01cant modi\ufb01cations are required for the proposed research, the Institutional Research Ethics Board must provide detailed written feedback to the applicant. In the case of research students, the feedback must also be provided to their Director of Studies or Lead Supervisor, as appropriate. If the issue cannot be resolved informally, applicants have the right to appeal. APPEALS If there are statutory requirements that specify different procedures for appeals, these will take precedence over the appeals procedures outlined in this Policy. Researchers who are bound by their own professional code of conduct should be aware that their own ethics policies may be more rigorous than those outlined in this Policy, and they must comply with their professional codes. Failure to comply with ethics approval may be deemed as serious professional misconduct, which the university is obligated to report to the researcher's professional body. 79 www.mitwpu.edu.in INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH ETHICS BOARD The university shall establish an Institutional Research Ethics Board to ensure that research activities conducted by researchers are fully compliant with the university's regulations on research ethics and the protectio n of human and non- human subjects involved in research.
