The CGPA is also calculated in the same manner taking into account all the courses undergone by a student overall in the semester/year of a program, i.e. \u2211 (Ci x Si ) CGPA = \u2211 (Ci ) Marks Range Grade Grade Description Grade Point 90-100 O Outstanding 10 80-89 A Excellent 9 70-79 B Good 8 60-69 C Fair 7 50-59 D Average 6 Less than 50 F Fail 0 AB AB Absent 0 Page 15 of 36 where Si is the SGPA of the ith semester/year and Ci is the total number of credits in that semester /year. Marks Range Grade Grade Description Grade Point Credit Point (Credit X Grade) Course 1 3 A 8 3 X 8 = 24 Course 2 4 B+ 7 4 X 7 = 28 Course 3 3 B+ 6 3 X 6 = 18 Course 4 3 O 10 3 x 10 = 30 Course 5 3 C 5 3 X 5 = 15 Course 6 2 F 0 0 Total 18 A 8 115 The SGPA and CGPA shall be rounded off to two decimal points and reported in the transcripts.

The university has an obligation to safeguard public funds and ensure that it delivers the assured value for mo ney to its students and other beneficiaries. The Tuition Fee Policy forms part of the university\u2019s Terms and Conditions and should be read in conjunction with them, for together they provide the comprehensive framework for the setting, payment, collection, and reconciliation of tuition fees. Course fees include all compulsory elements needed for students to meet the minimum learning outcomes of the course. In some courses, optional additional costs may be incurred. The purpose of this policy is to set out the tuition fee liability that applies to students upon enrolment on a course/programme of study. Scope This policy relates to: \u27a2 Student tuition fee liability This policy does not relate to: \u27a2 Non-refundable tuition fee deposits \u27a2 Accommodation fees 37 | P a g e Policy \u27a2 All students bear a personal liability for the tuition fee associated with any course/programme of study for which they enrol. \u27a2 All students must enrol for each successive year or another relevant part of their course/courses at MIT World Peace University no later than 30 days after the stating date of the respective course/courses). o Upon non -completion of enrolment by/before the prescribed deadline dates, students will be withdrawn from their ongoing course. Once withdrawn, the students\u2019 ID card will be deactivated following which they will not be able to attend lectures, use the libr ary, submit, or sit for assessments or take part in any other academic activity. \u27a2 The University has a ' fixed fee ' policy for tuition fee meaning that the fee charged at the beginning of the programme remains the same throughout that particular programme. \u27a2 The ' fixed fee ' policy will apply even if a student interrupts or repeats another year of study. \u27a2 It is the students\u2019 responsibility to ensure that they will be able to pay for their entire course duration prior to enrolment. \u27a2 Enrolment will not be permitted unless any/all outstanding debt(s) from the previous year has been paid in full or an instalment plan has been agreed upon by the university\u2019s Fee Team. \u27a2 IMPORTANT: Students are legally responsible for payment of their complete tuition fee themselves, whether they have an SLC loan or a sponsor. If the sponsor does not pay the university, or if the students find out that they are not eligible for a SLC loan, or they lose 38 | P a g e their eligibility for an SLC loan at any time after the commencement of the course, the students will be liable to pay their own fees for any/all periods of study that is not paid for by a sponsor or the SLC. This applies to all forms of undergraduate and postgraduate fee. \u27a2 Students who are considering discontinuing their programme of study are encouraged to first consult with the University for Advice and Guidance before making the final decision to leave. Further information on the range of support available can be found on the university website. \u27a2 In all cases, wherein a student withdraws from or discontinues their studies, or is granted a period of leave of absence from their studies, the date of withdrawal/discontinuation/leave of absence is accounted for by the university towards calculating the cumulative tuition fee liability. \u27a2 For students who are sponsored, in the event of the sponsor not making payment in respect of the tuition fees, the student will be personally liable for the payment. \u27a2 Students funded by the Student Loans Company (SLC) will be liable for payment of either 50% or 100% of the tuition fee loan, in line with SLC policy in case of discontinuation mid - programme. For undergraduate students starting in August, the liability will stand at 50% in case the withdrawal takes place before course commencement & remaining 50% will be liable after completion of 90 days from the course commencement date. \u27a2 The university reserves the right to take appropriate action against students who fail to pay their fees, or make satisfactory arrangements to pay on, or by the end of a set period after the starting date of their course. When to pay fees: Students either can make the full payment or can opt for the payment in instalments as per the fee payment schedule declared and published by the university. First Installment Fee will have to be paid in full for the seat to be confirmed in candidate \u2019s name (no parti al payments are permitted) .

The university has an obligation to safeguard public funds and ensure that it delivers the assured value for mo ney to its students and other beneficiaries. The Tuition Fee Policy forms part of the university\u2019s Terms and Conditions and should be read in conjunction with them, for together they provide the comprehensive framework for the setting, payment, collection, and reconciliation of tuition fees. Course fees include all compulsory elements needed for students to meet the minimum learning outcomes of the course. In some courses, optional additional costs may be incurred. The purpose of this policy is to set out the tuition fee liability that applies to students upon enrolment on a course/programme of study. Scope This policy relates to: \u27a2 Student tuition fee liability This policy does not relate to: \u27a2 Non-refundable tuition fee deposits \u27a2 Accommodation fees 37 | P a g e Policy \u27a2 All students bear a personal liability for the tuition fee associated with any course/programme of study for which they enrol. \u27a2 All students must enrol for each successive year or another relevant part of their course/courses at MIT World Peace University no later than 30 days after the stating date of the respective course/courses). o Upon non -completion of enrolment by/before the prescribed deadline dates, students will be withdrawn from their ongoing course. Once withdrawn, the students\u2019 ID card will be deactivated following which they will not be able to attend lectures, use the libr ary, submit, or sit for assessments or take part in any other academic activity. \u27a2 The University has a ' fixed fee ' policy for tuition fee meaning that the fee charged at the beginning of the programme remains the same throughout that particular programme. \u27a2 The ' fixed fee ' policy will apply even if a student interrupts or repeats another year of study. \u27a2 It is the students\u2019 responsibility to ensure that they will be able to pay for their entire course duration prior to enrolment. \u27a2 Enrolment will not be permitted unless any/all outstanding debt(s) from the previous year has been paid in full or an instalment plan has been agreed upon by the university\u2019s Fee Team. \u27a2 IMPORTANT: Students are legally responsible for payment of their complete tuition fee themselves, whether they have an SLC loan or a sponsor. If the sponsor does not pay the university, or if the students find out that they are not eligible for a SLC loan, or they lose 38 | P a g e their eligibility for an SLC loan at any time after the commencement of the course, the students will be liable to pay their own fees for any/all periods of study that is not paid for by a sponsor or the SLC. This applies to all forms of undergraduate and postgraduate fee. \u27a2 Students who are considering discontinuing their programme of study are encouraged to first consult with the University for Advice and Guidance before making the final decision to leave. Further information on the range of support available can be found on the university website. \u27a2 In all cases, wherein a student withdraws from or discontinues their studies, or is granted a period of leave of absence from their studies, the date of withdrawal/discontinuation/leave of absence is accounted for by the university towards calculating the cumulative tuition fee liability. \u27a2 For students who are sponsored, in the event of the sponsor not making payment in respect of the tuition fees, the student will be personally liable for the payment. \u27a2 Students funded by the Student Loans Company (SLC) will be liable for payment of either 50% or 100% of the tuition fee loan, in line with SLC policy in case of discontinuation mid - programme. For undergraduate students starting in August, the liability will stand at 50% in case the withdrawal takes place before course commencement & remaining 50% will be liable after completion of 90 days from the course commencement date. \u27a2 The university reserves the right to take appropriate action against students who fail to pay their fees, or make satisfactory arrangements to pay on, or by the end of a set period after the starting date of their course. When to pay fees: Students either can make the full payment or can opt for the payment in instalments as per the fee payment schedule declared and published by the university. First Installment Fee will have to be paid in full for the seat to be confirmed in candidate \u2019s name (no parti al payments are permitted) .

Academic Guidelines ABC ID (Academic Bank of Credits ID) Academic Bank of Credits has been established on the lines of the National Academic Depository (NAD), in the sense, NAD is the backbone of ABC, where the students' academic data are held and academic awards are stored (i.e. storehouse of academic awards). Despite the fact that ABC enables students to register or commence credit transfer, the final outcomes of credit redemption and issuance of certificates, as well as the compilation of award records, are administered by academic institutions via the NAD Platform. Hence being the owner of academic awards, Academic Institutions must mandatorily register themselves under ABC via NAD. The detail guidelines in this regard are available with following link: https://www.abc.gov.in/assets/resources/Step_by_Step_Guide_ABCID_Students.pdf Credit Structure Credit structure is defined in terms of contact hours assigned for various academic components of a program. This includes classroom lectures, tutorials, practical sessions, projects, seminars, lab work, group work internship, immersion programs and any other academic activity for which contact hours are assigned in the curriculum. The credit details are as follows: Details Credit Equivalence in hrs per week Total Hours in a min. 15 weeks Class room teaching 1 credit 1 hour 15 hrs Lab/Tutorial/group/presentation work 1 credit 2 hours 30 hrs Lab / Tutorial (applicable for Technical Schools) 1 credit 1 hour 15 hrs Seminar (subject to schedule throughout semester) 1 credit 2 hours 30 hrs Project work& Dissertation 1 credit 2 hours 30 hrs Internship 1 credits - 40 hrs The broad components of evaluation for any course/subject may be as follows.

For more details on Academic / Project guidelines, refer Part II for school specific inputs. xii. Feedback Mechanism: MIT -WPU has a well -established online feedback mechanism through ERP for communication of perceptions. Online Feedback through ERP is taken using a questionnaire preferably in the last session of every course in each term. This feedback is compiled, and statistics are placed before 26 each faculty member by the end of the term. All students should get involved in this mechanism seriously as it truly helps the MIT -WPU improve the quality of services and teaching provided. These are open ended questions in which student can reflect learning and teaching aspects of the course. MIT-WPU uses feedback to improve the teaching learning process proactively. While sharing the feedback to the faculty members, student\u2019s identity is kept confidential. Adding and Dropping of Courses i) A student on the recommendation of his Academic Counselor duly endorsed by his HOD may be allowed by the Director of the School to add or drop course(s) within a period of two weeks from the date of commencement of a term as notified in Academic calendar. ii) A student who is on disciplinary probation may be allowed to change the course, only with the approval of the Vice\u2010Chancellor. iii) A student may be required to drop a course at any stage if it is found that he does not meet the pre\u2010 requisites of the course, or if there is a clash in the student \u2019s timetable preventing him from attending the course, or if he is found not entitled to register for that course for any other reason(s 27 4. Guidelines for Choice -Based Credit System (CBCS): - The CBCS offering is a concept which is in line with NEP 2020 and the international academic system. The selection of CBCS courses across different streams will enable students to the knowledge of other domains. To support CBCS, MIT-WPU offered specialized tracks and several professional/open electives.

I have read the University\u2019s policy on plagiarism and understand the definition of plagiarism as given in this manual. If it is shown that material has been plagiarized, or I have otherwise attempted to obtain an unfair advantage for myself or others, I understand that I may face sanctions in accordancewith the policies and procedures of the University. A mark of zero may be awarded and the reason for that mark will be recorded on my file. 7. Plagiarism Policy MIT-WPU plagiarism policy is that plagiarism, whether deliberate or unintentional, is a form of cheating and is unacceptable. It is expected that all students are educated in correct academic practice, including writing and referencing, early in their careers at the University and know what is expected of them and understand the meaning of plagiarism and its consequences. Definition of plagiarism MIT-WPU definition of plagiarism makes explicit that copying from texts or web or other sources and copying work from other students constitutes plagiarism. It reads: 1. Plagiarism is the act of taking or copying someone else\u2019s work, including another student\u2019s, and presenting it as if it were one\u2019s own. 2. Plagiarism is said to occur when ideas, texts, theories, data, created artistic artefacts or other material are presented without acknowledgement so that the person considering this work is given the impression that what they have before them is the student\u2019s own original work when it is not. 3. Plagiarism also occurs where a student\u2019s own work is re\u2010presented without being properly referenced. 4. Plagiarism is a form of cheating and is a disciplinary offence. Student declaration The standard coursework submission sheet for the receipting of coursework includes an explicit reference to the University\u2019s definition of plagiarism as follows. Types of Plagiarism 1. Using another writers\u2019 words without proper citation. If you use another writers\u2019 words, you must place quotation marks around the quoted material and include a footnote or other indication of the source of the quotation. 2. Using another writers\u2019 ideas without proper citation. When you use another author\u2019s ideas, you must indicate with footnotes or other means where this information can be found. Your instructors want to know 36 which ideas and judgments are yours and which you arrived at by consulting other sources. Even if you arrived at the same judgment on your own, you need to acknowledge that the writer you consulted also came up with the idea. 3. Citing your source but reproducing the exact words of a printed source without quotation marks. This makes it appear that you have paraphrased rather than borrowed the author\u2019s exact words. 4. Borrowing the structure of another author\u2019s phrases or sentences without crediting the author from whom it came. This kind of plagiarism usually occurs out of laziness: it is easier to replicate another writers\u2019 style than to think about what you have read and then put it in your own words. 5. Borrowing all or part of another student\u2019s paper or using someone else\u2019s outline to write your own paper. 6.

Personal counselling is very important at every step in life even at the corporate level. What we think about situations affects our subconscious mind deeply which interferes with our present life and hinders our ability to lead a healthy life. As normal human beings at any given time in life we could go through challenging times and have no one to share or guide us. We often do not share our issues with family or friends due to the fear of upsetting them. We worry that perhaps they may not understand or could become judgmental. At such times we recommend Personal Counselling. \u2022 \u201cI cannot concentrate or focus nor can I sleep, at times I get so scared that I go blank in my exams!\u201d \u2022 \u201cSince the time he left me I cannot put my attention to anything I will not be able to live anymore\u2026\u2026\u2026 can\u2019t bear it if she is not in my life!\u201d \u2022 \u201cI have lost my confidence I feel worthless /hopeless; no one loves me. I don\u2019t want to live anymore\u201d. \u2022 Nobody understands what I am going through\u2026.people become judgemental instead of understanding and supporting, Whom to share it with? \u2022 Where do I seek help? Who will be able to really help? Have you had any of these repetitive thoughts or are you facing a rejection that you are not able to cope up with? Have you reacted very angrily first and then later realized that reacting to the event was not really needed and in the process you harmed the relations you had with your friends and family? You just do not know what went wrong then? Do not understand what triggered you? Just as we would treat a sprain with some ointment, we try to heal our emotional pain on our own. At times when the sprain is not healing we visit the doctor and similarly one visits the counsellor sometimes when we are unable to clear our own emotional challenges. The counsellor needs to check how deep your wound is and usually you are helped by putting a plaster of protection (counselling). Sometimes the wound may have been too deep /chronic or your bone is broken it could also need psychiatric intervention and give appropriate 52 help. We may be unaware of the implications of our behavior on others but it eventually could affect our relations in daily life at home, in class, or at work. When the past emotional situations are not dealt with therapeutically, we could develop unhealthy negative thoughts and feelings which we need to be aware of as they could again lead to complications and could affect our performance, decision making, logical thinking, studies, relationships, and career. This form of continued stress can gradually affect our body and physiological health causing hypertension, respiratory ailments, gastrointestinal disturbances, migraine and tension headaches, pelvic pain, impotence, frigidity, dermatitis, and ulcers. The biggest myth is to believe that to be emotional is to be weak so often we push all our emotional issues under the blanket and then to avoid sleepless nights take up unhealthy habitslike smoking, drinking, and substance abuse. We do this hoping to feel better which lasts only forshort term on the other hand creating long term damage and may lead to unhealthy dependency. MIT-WPU wants to ensure holistic development of the students and therefore have appointed a team of psychologists and a counsellor.
