The university has an obligation to safeguard public funds and ensure that it delivers the assured value for mo ney to its students and other beneficiaries. The Tuition Fee Policy forms part of the university\u2019s Terms and Conditions and should be read in conjunction with them, for together they provide the comprehensive framework for the setting, payment, collection, and reconciliation of tuition fees. Course fees include all compulsory elements needed for students to meet the minimum learning outcomes of the course. In some courses, optional additional costs may be incurred. The purpose of this policy is to set out the tuition fee liability that applies to students upon enrolment on a course/programme of study. Scope This policy relates to: \u27a2 Student tuition fee liability This policy does not relate to: \u27a2 Non-refundable tuition fee deposits \u27a2 Accommodation fees 37 | P a g e Policy \u27a2 All students bear a personal liability for the tuition fee associated with any course/programme of study for which they enrol. \u27a2 All students must enrol for each successive year or another relevant part of their course/courses at MIT World Peace University no later than 30 days after the stating date of the respective course/courses). o Upon non -completion of enrolment by/before the prescribed deadline dates, students will be withdrawn from their ongoing course. Once withdrawn, the students\u2019 ID card will be deactivated following which they will not be able to attend lectures, use the libr ary, submit, or sit for assessments or take part in any other academic activity. \u27a2 The University has a ' fixed fee ' policy for tuition fee meaning that the fee charged at the beginning of the programme remains the same throughout that particular programme. \u27a2 The ' fixed fee ' policy will apply even if a student interrupts or repeats another year of study. \u27a2 It is the students\u2019 responsibility to ensure that they will be able to pay for their entire course duration prior to enrolment. \u27a2 Enrolment will not be permitted unless any/all outstanding debt(s) from the previous year has been paid in full or an instalment plan has been agreed upon by the university\u2019s Fee Team. \u27a2 IMPORTANT: Students are legally responsible for payment of their complete tuition fee themselves, whether they have an SLC loan or a sponsor. If the sponsor does not pay the university, or if the students find out that they are not eligible for a SLC loan, or they lose 38 | P a g e their eligibility for an SLC loan at any time after the commencement of the course, the students will be liable to pay their own fees for any/all periods of study that is not paid for by a sponsor or the SLC. This applies to all forms of undergraduate and postgraduate fee. \u27a2 Students who are considering discontinuing their programme of study are encouraged to first consult with the University for Advice and Guidance before making the final decision to leave. Further information on the range of support available can be found on the university website. \u27a2 In all cases, wherein a student withdraws from or discontinues their studies, or is granted a period of leave of absence from their studies, the date of withdrawal/discontinuation/leave of absence is accounted for by the university towards calculating the cumulative tuition fee liability. \u27a2 For students who are sponsored, in the event of the sponsor not making payment in respect of the tuition fees, the student will be personally liable for the payment. \u27a2 Students funded by the Student Loans Company (SLC) will be liable for payment of either 50% or 100% of the tuition fee loan, in line with SLC policy in case of discontinuation mid - programme. For undergraduate students starting in August, the liability will stand at 50% in case the withdrawal takes place before course commencement & remaining 50% will be liable after completion of 90 days from the course commencement date. \u27a2 The university reserves the right to take appropriate action against students who fail to pay their fees, or make satisfactory arrangements to pay on, or by the end of a set period after the starting date of their course. When to pay fees: Students either can make the full payment or can opt for the payment in instalments as per the fee payment schedule declared and published by the university. First Installment Fee will have to be paid in full for the seat to be confirmed in candidate \u2019s name (no parti al payments are permitted) .

The SGPA is the ratio of summation of the product of the number of credits with the grade points scored by a student i n all the courses taken by a student in semester/ annual and the sum of the number of credits of all the courses undergone by a student, i.e. SGPA (Si ) = \u2211 ( Ci x Gi ) \u2211 (Ci ) where Ci is the number of credits of the ith registered course, and Gi is the grade point scored by the student in the ith registered course. The CGPA is also calculated in the same manner taking into account all the courses undergone by a student overall in the semester/year of a program, i.e. \u2211 (Ci x Si ) CGPA = \u2211 (Ci ) Marks Range Grade Grade Description Grade Point 90-100 O Outstanding 10 80-89 A Excellent 9 70-79 B Good 8 60-69 C Fair 7 50-59 D Average 6 Less than 50 F Fail 0 AB AB Absent 0 Page 15 of 36 where Si is the SGPA of the ith semester/year and Ci is the total number of credits in that semester /year. Marks Range Grade Grade Description Grade Point Credit Point (Credit X Grade) Course 1 3 A 8 3 X 8 = 24 Course 2 4 B+ 7 4 X 7 = 28 Course 3 3 B+ 6 3 X 6 = 18 Course 4 3 O 10 3 x 10 = 30 Course 5 3 C 5 3 X 5 = 15 Course 6 2 F 0 0 Total 18 A 8 115 The SGPA and CGPA shall be rounded off to two decimal points and reported in the transcripts.

The university has an obligation to safeguard public funds and ensure that it delivers the assured value for mo ney to its students and other beneficiaries. The Tuition Fee Policy forms part of the university\u2019s Terms and Conditions and should be read in conjunction with them, for together they provide the comprehensive framework for the setting, payment, collection, and reconciliation of tuition fees. Course fees include all compulsory elements needed for students to meet the minimum learning outcomes of the course. In some courses, optional additional costs may be incurred. The purpose of this policy is to set out the tuition fee liability that applies to students upon enrolment on a course/programme of study. Scope This policy relates to: \u27a2 Student tuition fee liability This policy does not relate to: \u27a2 Non-refundable tuition fee deposits \u27a2 Accommodation fees 37 | P a g e Policy \u27a2 All students bear a personal liability for the tuition fee associated with any course/programme of study for which they enrol. \u27a2 All students must enrol for each successive year or another relevant part of their course/courses at MIT World Peace University no later than 30 days after the stating date of the respective course/courses). o Upon non -completion of enrolment by/before the prescribed deadline dates, students will be withdrawn from their ongoing course. Once withdrawn, the students\u2019 ID card will be deactivated following which they will not be able to attend lectures, use the libr ary, submit, or sit for assessments or take part in any other academic activity. \u27a2 The University has a ' fixed fee ' policy for tuition fee meaning that the fee charged at the beginning of the programme remains the same throughout that particular programme. \u27a2 The ' fixed fee ' policy will apply even if a student interrupts or repeats another year of study. \u27a2 It is the students\u2019 responsibility to ensure that they will be able to pay for their entire course duration prior to enrolment. \u27a2 Enrolment will not be permitted unless any/all outstanding debt(s) from the previous year has been paid in full or an instalment plan has been agreed upon by the university\u2019s Fee Team. \u27a2 IMPORTANT: Students are legally responsible for payment of their complete tuition fee themselves, whether they have an SLC loan or a sponsor. If the sponsor does not pay the university, or if the students find out that they are not eligible for a SLC loan, or they lose 38 | P a g e their eligibility for an SLC loan at any time after the commencement of the course, the students will be liable to pay their own fees for any/all periods of study that is not paid for by a sponsor or the SLC. This applies to all forms of undergraduate and postgraduate fee. \u27a2 Students who are considering discontinuing their programme of study are encouraged to first consult with the University for Advice and Guidance before making the final decision to leave. Further information on the range of support available can be found on the university website. \u27a2 In all cases, wherein a student withdraws from or discontinues their studies, or is granted a period of leave of absence from their studies, the date of withdrawal/discontinuation/leave of absence is accounted for by the university towards calculating the cumulative tuition fee liability. \u27a2 For students who are sponsored, in the event of the sponsor not making payment in respect of the tuition fees, the student will be personally liable for the payment. \u27a2 Students funded by the Student Loans Company (SLC) will be liable for payment of either 50% or 100% of the tuition fee loan, in line with SLC policy in case of discontinuation mid - programme. For undergraduate students starting in August, the liability will stand at 50% in case the withdrawal takes place before course commencement & remaining 50% will be liable after completion of 90 days from the course commencement date. \u27a2 The university reserves the right to take appropriate action against students who fail to pay their fees, or make satisfactory arrangements to pay on, or by the end of a set period after the starting date of their course. When to pay fees: Students either can make the full payment or can opt for the payment in instalments as per the fee payment schedule declared and published by the university. First Installment Fee will have to be paid in full for the seat to be confirmed in candidate \u2019s name (no parti al payments are permitted) .

The SGPA is the ratio of summation of the product of the number of credits with the grade points scored by a student i n all the courses taken by a student in semester/ annual and the sum of the number of credits of all the courses undergone by a student, i.e. SGPA (Si ) = \u2211 ( Ci x Gi ) \u2211 (Ci ) where Ci is the number of credits of the ith registered course, and Gi is the grade point scored by the student in the ith registered course. The CGPA is also calculated in the same manner taking into account all the courses undergone by a student overall in the semester/year of a program, i.e. \u2211 (Ci x Si ) CGPA = \u2211 (Ci ) Marks Range Grade Grade Description Grade Point 90-100 O Outstanding 10 80-89 A Excellent 9 70-79 B Good 8 60-69 C Fair 7 50-59 D Average 6 Less than 50 F Fail 0 AB AB Absent 0 Page 15 of 36 where Si is the SGPA of the ith semester/year and Ci is the total number of credits in that semester /year. Marks Range Grade Grade Description Grade Point Credit Point (Credit X Grade) Course 1 3 A 8 3 X 8 = 24 Course 2 4 B+ 7 4 X 7 = 28 Course 3 3 B+ 6 3 X 6 = 18 Course 4 3 O 10 3 x 10 = 30 Course 5 3 C 5 3 X 5 = 15 Course 6 2 F 0 0 Total 18 A 8 115 The SGPA and CGPA shall be rounded off to two decimal points and reported in the transcripts.
