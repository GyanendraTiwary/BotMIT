Computation of SGPA and CGPA: The University follows the following procedure to compute the Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) and Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA). The SGPA is the ratio of summation of the product of the number of credits with the grade points scored by a student i n all the courses taken by a student in semester/ annual and the sum of the number of credits of all the courses undergone by a student, i.e. SGPA (Si ) = \u2211 ( Ci x Gi ) \u2211 (Ci ) where Ci is the number of credits of the ith registered course, and Gi is the grade point scored by the student in the ith registered course. The CGPA is also calculated in the same manner taking into account all the courses undergone by a student overall in the semester/year of a program, i.e. \u2211 (Ci x Si ) CGPA = \u2211 (Ci ) Marks Range Grade Grade Description Grade Point 90-100 O Outstanding 10 80-89 A Excellent 9 70-79 B Good 8 60-69 C Fair 7 50-59 D Average 6 Less than 50 F Fail 0 AB AB Absent 0 Page 15 of 36 where Si is the SGPA of the ith semester/year and Ci is the total number of credits in that semester /year. Marks Range Grade Grade Description Grade Point Credit Point (Credit X Grade) Course 1 3 A 8 3 X 8 = 24 Course 2 4 B+ 7 4 X 7 = 28 Course 3 3 B+ 6 3 X 6 = 18 Course 4 3 O 10 3 x 10 = 30 Course 5 3 C 5 3 X 5 = 15 Course 6 2 F 0 0 Total 18 A 8 115 The SGPA and CGPA shall be rounded off to two decimal points and reported in the transcripts.
